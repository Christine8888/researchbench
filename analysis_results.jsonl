This causes pesummary's `read()` function to raise an OSError (`OSError: [Errno 30] Read-only file system: ...`).

The immediate task was to perform Voronoi binning on the J080427 data cube, following the methodology specified in the paper. The AI correctly attempted to load the data file, compute the signal and noise for each pixel consistent with the methods in the paper, and performed Voronoi binning using the vorbin.voronoi_2d_binning package. Initial attempts to load the data failed due to an incorrect file path, but the AI eventually located the correct file under a more deeply nested directory (/MUSE_outflows/MUSE_outflows/J080427.npz). The AI then executed code to perform SNR-based masking, binning, and produced the expected output variables: the number of pixels considered and the number of resulting bins.\n\nHowever, after achieving a partial result for task 3 (voronoi_binning_for_emission_lines_J080427), the system encountered several repeated timeouts when attempting to write the result to submission.json using the 'text_editor' tool.

Only the voronoi binning task was completed; all other required outputs remained null. The process was heavily impacted by timeouts and errors related to tool execution for file writing.", "bugs": "1. **Incorrect File Path / Data Layout Confusion**: The AI first failed to load the expected data file due to an outdated or mis-specified file path (/MUSE_outflows/J080427.npz does not exist; file is at /MUSE_outflows/MUSE_outflows/J080427.npz). The data layout/nesting is non-obvious, which led to wasted attempts and errors. (Though the AI did recover by finding the correct path, this is an environment/deployment friction point.)\n\n2. **Repeated Tool Timeouts (text_editor)**: After producing the correct outputs, the AI made several attempts to write (create) submission.json using the 'text_editor' tool. Every attempt resulted in a \"Command timed out before completing\" error. This created significant delays and forced retries, never successfully producing the required submission file via the intended mechanism.\n\n3. **Fallback to Bash**: The AI eventually used the 'bash' tool to create submission.json with an echo statement, which succeeded. The repeated failures of the main 'text_editor' tool led to an inefficient (and potentially error-prone) workaround.\n\n4. **NameError in Python Script**: In multiple runs of its Voronoi-binning code, the AI encountered a NameError due to an inconsistent use of 'ny' vs. 'nny', causing the script to crash before reaching completion. This error was resolved in subsequent runs, but represents a code robustness issue (potentially in the code generation, not the environment).\n\n5. **Matplotlib Cache Directory Warnings**: All Python executions that import matplotlib throw warnings about the default cache directory (/home/users/cye/.cache/matplotlib) not being writable, causing Matplotlib to create a temporary cache in /tmp. While not fatal, this indicates persistent environment misconfiguration that could impact downstream performance (especially for parallel workload or repeated plotting).\n\n6. **Inconsistent Use of Tool Parameters (timeout)**: The 'python' tool appears to reject the 'timeout' argument (e.g., \"Found 1 validation errors parsing tool input arguments: - Additional properties are not allowed ('timeout' was unexpected)\"), even though AI code attempts to set it\u2014likely due to mismatched tool API schema.\n\n7. **System/database latency or overload**: Many bash/text_editor tool commands stall out or timeout, especially when writing files. This suggests either (a) resource contention/overload, (b) write lock contention, or (c) insufficient sandbox or tool process runtime limits.\n\n8. **Multiple attempts to write submission.json (duplicate/unproductive work)**: The AI attempted to create submission.json with identical values via text_editor multiple times (both with no progress between attempts and continuing after previous timeouts).\n\nSummary: The main technical issue is persistent timeouts and failures in file write operations via the text_editor tool, only partially mitigated by bash fallback.

These occurred even on fairly trivial create/view actions, suggesting a mismatch between tool timeout durations and the time required to operate on large files or system slowness. However, none of these timeouts ultimately blocked the core numeric pipeline, likely because the AI switched to using Python for file reading/writing.\n3. **Initial failed file access attempt**: Attempt to read /oak/stanford/projects/c4u/researchbench/workspace/galaxy_soptics/Millenium_DeLucia_catalog.txt (with a bash \"head\") failed (\"No such file or directory\"), because the actual file was named Millenium_DeLucia2006a_0-50_snapnum63.txt.
