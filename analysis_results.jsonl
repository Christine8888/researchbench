The approach included: exploring the directory structure, inspecting data and likelihood package files, examining the format of the bandpower/covariance/binning data, and scripting the likelihood fitting procedure. The AI made progress in stepping through (and scripting) the correct data workflow. However, progress was slowed by repeated use of environment commands that timed out, especially for \"text_editor\" file viewing commands. In the end, it started creating a Python script to do the \\(A_{\\text{lens}}\\) fit, but it appears the script creation itself also ran into a timeout.\n\nSegment 2: The AI attempted to reproduce the results from the \"lensing-dr6-growth\" paper, specifically focusing on reading ACT DR6 lensing bandpowers, covariance matrices, and performing parameter estimation, including fitting the CMB lensing amplitude (Alens). The transcript shows a step-by-step exploratory process:\n\n1. The AI browsed the environment, successfully listing relevant data files and confirming the presence of bandpower, covariance, and binning matrix files.\n2. It used Python and shell commands to view, read, and print out the shapes and samples of crucial data files, verifying their structure (bandpowers array, covariance matrix, binning matrix).\n3. The AI attempted to open the main lensing code files for analysis but encountered repeated timeouts with the text_editor tool when trying to view or modify files in the workspace directory, though these steps were auxiliary.\n4. It executed and iteratively improved Python scripts for loading the data and fitting the lensing amplitude parameter Alens, identifying required data pre-processing steps (removing the first 2 and last 6 elements) and using the binning matrix.\n5. There was a mistaken attempt to use array multiplications (`np.dot(binm, clkk)`) that resulted in a shape mismatch error (3000 vs. 4001), which the AI recognized and corrected by slicing `clkk[:3000]`, resolving the error.\n6. After successful troubleshooting, the AI produced the expected outputs for both required tasks, outputting the results as a JSON dict as specified.\n\nOverall, the AI did succeed in completing the extraction, data preprocessing, and parameter estimation parts of the task, resolving most issues through code iteration and by inspecting the data.", "bugs": "Segment 1: - **Timeouts on file viewing or text editor commands**: The transcript is full of \"Command timed out before completing\" errors when the AI tried to use the text_editor tool to either view or create files, both in the main lenslike package and for viewing/creating scripts (\"task2_fit_alens.py\"). This occurs frequently and severely interrupts the AI\u2019s workflow.\n- **General slowness/long latency**: Many tool calls (especially file viewing and creation) are slow and do not return results in a timely fashion, often timing out before the operation is finished.\n- **No visible stdout feedback from text_editor create/write attempts**: When the AI tried to create a script with the text_editor tool, the command times out, and there is no confirmation about file creation, hindering progress.\n- **Python tool worked**: In contrast, calls to the python tool to inspect data files or run short code snippets generally worked correctly and returned expected output. There were no environment-level errors in these.\n- **No permission/path errors for data files**: All `np.loadtxt` operations on dataset files succeeded, so data and Python environment are properly accessible and configured.\n- **No out-of-memory or disk issues**: None observed\u2014operations on reasonable slices of arrays and files all succeed.\n\nSegment 2: - **Repeated timeouts with 'text_editor' tool in workspace directories:** Several attempts to use the 'text_editor' tool (both 'view' and 'create' commands) to access files in `/oak/stanford/projects/c4u/researchbench/workspace/lensing_dr6_growth/overlay/upper/usr/local/lib/python3.12/site-packages/act_dr6_lenslike/` timed out (`Command timed out before completing.`). These repeated timeouts could limit the model from examining or modifying necessary source code. Viewing files in workspace directories with this tool seems slow or not functional.\n- **Shape mismatch in dot product (matrix multiplication):** There was a non-environmental (user code) bug related to array shapes\u2014trying to perform `np.dot(binm, clkk)` where `binm` was (18,3000) and `clkk` was (4001,). The error message shown: `ValueError: shapes (18,3000) and (4001,) not aligned: 3000 (dim 1) != 4001 (dim 0)`. However, this was resolved by slicing `clkk[:3000]` and is not an environment bug.\n- **None observed related to Python execution, file reading, library presence, disk space, or permissions:** All core Python tools such as NumPy, CAMB, and file I/O operated as expected, with no failures in library imports or out-of-memory/messages, and no permission errors when accessing files.", "metadata": {"paper_name": "lensing_dr6_growth", "model": "openai/o4-mini", "status": "success", "started_at": "2025-07-26T01:58:24-07:00", "completed_at": "2025-07-26T02:05:58-07:00", "runtime_minutes": 7.566666666666666, "token_stats": {"input_tokens": 1965276, "output_tokens": 13601, "total_tokens": 1978877, "reasoning_tokens": 9216}, "accuracy": 0.0, "task_results": {}}, "was_truncated": true}

This is likely an environment or toolchain issue, as the final answer appears to have been generated and passed to the submit() function, but no corresponding JSON file was written to the file system for the scorer to evaluate. This is a technical failure in the result submission pipeline.\n- **Timeouts in File Viewing:** The AI experienced a timeout while trying to view the first 20 rows of the CSV via the \"text_editor\" tool (`Command timed out before completing.` for viewing the CSV). While the AI recovered by reading the file with pandas using the python tool, the repeated timeouts suggest the file is large and the view tool has insufficient timeout/buffering.\n- **Ephemeral Python Environment (State Loss):** When the AI tried to run isolated python commands (e.g., `print(df['algorithm_name'].unique())`), it produced errors like `NameError: name 'df' is not defined`, because each python execution is stateless. Variable/context loss between executions is expected, but can cause confusing failures if not handled properly for step-wise analysis.\n- **\"classifier_performance\" Not Attempted / Not Run:** The AI did not attempt model training for the classifier_performance task, returning [0, 0, 0, 0] as a placeholder in the final JSON. This may be due to environment restrictions (e.g., missing TensorFlow dependencies, inability to write to necessary folders, or resource constraints for training a model), or because it did not script actual model training.

It first explored the file system for the required dataset, checked the contents of directories, and inspected the available FITS files for the target galaxies. It then tried to analyze the FITS file structure programmatically to identify which data layers correspond to needed features (e.g., emission line maps like OIII_5007_FLUX), and accessed the AGN catalog to determine which sample galaxies are AGN hosts.\n\nFor the PCA analysis tasks, it attempted to use a provided script (`phangs_pca.py`) designed to load features from all galaxies, assemble a data matrix, perform PCA, and calculate explained variance/correlations. It attempted to run this script using both the Python executor and the bash tool.\n\nFor the AGN catalog matching task, the agent parsed the catalog multiple ways to match the galaxies' names and AGN types, eventually succeeding in matching names by parsing the text into tokens rather than relying on fixed-width strings.\n\nHowever, several attempts to run the PCA analysis failed because the data (as stored in the FITS files) did not contain extensions with the expected names, particularly 'OIII_5007_FLUX'. This resulted in errors and the script collecting no features from any galaxy, so later steps of the analysis pipeline could not run PCA or return variance/correlation results.\n\nSegment 2: The AI attempted to reproduce results from the PHANGS-PAHs paper, focusing on scientific data extraction and processing with Python, bash, and text editing tools. The main tasks included: parsing a catalog to identify AGN hosts, running a provided PCA analysis script, and then writing and running custom scripts to compute statistical fits (slopes) for binned astronomical data. The AI systematically explored data files, wrote code to analyze them, and tried to modify and create Python scripts on disk to perform the desired computations. It handled both bash and Python execution, as well as file editing via a text editor tool.\n\nWhile the AI was able to eventually run the PCA task and interpret output, it encountered limitations, especially with long-running or complex file editing operations. Some code execution generated warnings, and outputs were occasionally truncated due to length restrictions.\n\nSegment 3: The AI attempted to reproduce results for several numerical/code tasks from the PHANGS-PAHs astrophysics paper, interacting with a code execution environment for data analysis. The main tasks included identifying AGN hosts by parsing an external catalog, performing PCA on features extracted from multi-wavelength galaxy maps, and calculating best-fit slopes and outlier fractions for certain galaxy properties. The workflow involved significant data handling (FITS files), writing and executing Python scripts, and, at times, using bash to navigate the file system and manage files. The AI successfully extracted the correct AGN hosts, corrected PCA code for the right feature names, and wrote revised analysis scripts to measure required statistics.\n\nDespite several obstacles, including library API mismatches and timeouts, the AI was able to obtain and submit results (e.g., PCA variance fractions, AGN host list, best-fitting slopes, outlier fractions) in the requested JSON format. The transcript evidences iterative debugging and adaptation (e.g., correcting for FITS extension name mismatches and addressing array/data issues). However, numerous tool/environment issues, unrelated to the AI's reasoning, had to be overcome.", "bugs": "Segment 1: - **Schema/API assumption mismatch**: The PCA pipeline expected emission line data extensions labeled, e.g., 'OIII_5007_FLUX', but these did not exist in the provided MAPS FITS files. This mismatch resulted in \"Extension 'OIII_5007_FLUX' not found\" errors for all galaxies (as reported in the PCA script error output). The pipeline could not collect any feature vectors for PCA, resulting in a further crash when trying to concatenate arrays (since none were collected).\n- **Silent fail in batch processing**: The script processed the list of galaxies but merely logged errors for each missing extension. Eventually, it failed with a non-informative numpy error (\"need at least one array to concatenate\"), because nothing was collected, obscuring the real cause for future tool calls.\n- **Incorrect tool usage syntax**: The AI attempted to run a notebook-style cell magic/command (e.g. `!python3 ...`) within the Python executor, which produced a syntax error, as this syntax is only valid in Jupyter, not in plain Python scripts. This caused a failed attempt to run the main script in the correct environment.\n- **Repeated parser/argument errors (Python executor)**: Several tool calls to the Python executor included a `timeout` parameter in the arguments, which the environment does not support, resulting in repeated `\"Found 1 validation errors parsing tool input arguments: ...('timeout' was unexpected)\"` errors. These are environment configuration issues that could be fixed by ignoring or stripping unsupported arguments.\n- **Missing imports in interactive Python calls**: When attempting to inspect or manipulate FITS files with the Python tool, sometimes the agent forgot required imports (e.g., `fits` from `astropy.io`) in \"incremental\" code blocks, resulting in `NameError: name 'fits' is not defined`. This points to the stateless design of the Python tool (warnings in system messages) and the agent's failure to always include full context.\n\nNone of these errors were due to timeouts, resource exhaustion, or classic file permission problems; all were related to either missing data keys, script design, argument passing, or model misunderstanding of the stateless code execution environment.\n\nSegment 2: - **Tool Argument Validation Error:** The Python tool failed when an unexpected argument (`timeout`) was included in the arguments. This led to repeated \"Additional properties are not allowed ('timeout' was unexpected)\" errors, blocking the AI from using per-execution timeouts.\n- **Text Editor Command Timeouts:** Multiple attempts to create or modify files via the `text_editor` tool led to `Command timed out before completing.` errors. These happened even for apparently reasonable script creation requests. It delayed code iteration and script usage.\n- **Bash Output Truncation:** Outputs from bash commands (e.g., when running data-intensive processing) were truncated with the message \"The output of your call to bash was too long to be displayed. Here is a truncated version ...\", limiting the AI's ability to review full logs.\n- **Python Script Execution Warnings:** Executing scientific Python scripts triggered numerous runtime warnings (divide by zero, invalid value in divide/log10) and FITS file WCS warnings. While not an environment bug per se, the volume and presentation could make debugging difficult for the AI.\n- **File Execution State Uncertainty:** Many tasks involved creating or updating files, but timeouts or opaque errors in the editing phase often left it unclear if the AI's latest code changes were actually written or if scripts reflected earlier failed/partial edits.\n- **Incorrect Use of ImageHDU.close():** In one case, a script failed due to AttributeError: 'ImageHDU' object has no attribute 'close'. While partly a model code bug, its diagnosis and reporting might have been made more difficult by output truncation and timeouts.\n\nSegment 3: - **Tool Timeouts (text_editor):** Multiple commands using the `text_editor` tool to create, replace, or update scripts timed out and did not complete successfully (e.g., `Command timed out before completing.` with 'create', 'str_replace' commands). This likely disrupted progress in several steps, requiring the AI to retry using new files or alternate editing strategies.\n- **Bash/Python Syntax Confusion:** The Python tool was occasionally invoked with scripts containing shell \"!\" syntax (`!python3 ...`), which is not valid in standalone Python scripts and caused syntax errors.\n- **File Not Found after Creation:** When creating files like `/tmp/best_slopes_fixed2.py`, subsequent attempts to run the files in the bash tool failed with \"No such file or directory\", suggesting a race condition or that file creation completed too slowly (perhaps due to previous timeouts), or else the file system is not consistently persisting created files for bash tool access.\n- **AttributeError on FITS HDU objects:** A bug in one analysis script called `hd.close()` on a FITS 'ImageHDU' object (from astropy), which doesn't have a .close() method. This interrupted the calculation of best-fitting slopes and required code regeneration.\n- **Code Crashes from Column Name Discrepancies:** The AI's scripts initially used FITS extension names like 'OIII_5007_FLUX', while the files actually used 'OIII5006_FLUX', 'HA6562_FLUX', etc., causing repeated KeyError/ExtensionNotFound errors that required code correction (fair in a sense, but occurs because of inconsistent naming conventions or documentation).\n- **Numpy LinAlgError (PCA/Slopes):** When data slices for some galaxies were too small or contained NaNs/Infs, `np.linalg.lstsq` failed with \"SVD did not converge\" (because of singular/degenerate matrices/too few points). The AI had to patch scripts to skip/handle these, but a more robust template would be ideal.\n- **ValueError: need at least one array to concatenate:** When the feature extraction code failed for all galaxies (due to mismatches or missing data), the final np.vstack(all_features) crashed due to the features list being empty, rather than failing gracefully.\n- **RuntimeWarnings and FITSFixedWarnings:** The code output log is full of numpy RuntimeWarnings (divide by zero, invalid value encountered) and Astropy FITSFixedWarnings (about date/geoheader corrections). While these are not critical, the volume of warnings indicates that the scripts were not robust against bad/missing data and could obscure useful error messages.\n- **Redundant/Failed Tool Usage:** There were failed tool calls that attempted to set a `timeout` parameter for the Python tool, which isn't supported and caused parsing errors. This required retrying without the timeout.\n- **Missing file system synchronization:** File creation with the text_editor tool and immediate bash access sometimes failed, possibly due to non-atomic file system updates.", "metadata": {"paper_name": "phangs_PAHs", "model": "openai/o4-mini", "status": "success", "started_at": "2025-07-26T01:57:19-07:00", "completed_at": "2025-07-26T02:18:41-07:00", "runtime_minutes": 21.366666666666667, "token_stats": {"input_tokens": 2178156, "output_tokens": 17450, "total_tokens": 2195606, "reasoning_tokens": 5440}, "accuracy": 0.0, "task_results": {}}, "was_truncated": true}

Where more complex calculations were needed, the AI wrote and executed scripts using the emcee MCMC sampler and direct grid likelihood evaluations, often outputting results in .npy or directly printing estimates. The AI successfully loaded posterior data for GW200105, computed requested quantiles, wrote and ran several scripts for population-level hierarchical inference, and output credible intervals for requested parameters. For the \"mass gap credibility\" task, it also constructed and ran a custom Python script grid-evaluating the likelihood, demonstrating a direct approach to the required calculation.\n\nHowever, there were points where the AI encountered non-obvious issues in the structure of the provided HDF5 files (e.g., missing or renamed analysis groups, subtle differences between events), which required a number of exploratory code executions.

The tasks required manipulating LIGO GW event posterior datasets to estimate credible intervals for physical parameters such as the NS maximum mass and mass gap, using population/hierarchical inference methods. The AI used a combination of bash scripting (for file management and script launching) and Python (with h5py and numpy, and sometimes emcee for MCMC) to implement these inferences.

These are mostly harmless but create noise and could mask real errors in critical cases.\n- **Tool Output Truncation**: On some occasions, the output from tools (mainly Python) was truncated due to excessive length, limiting the model\u2019s ability to see all the details it might need, especially in exploring HDF5 file structures.\n- **Inconsistent HDF5 File Structures**: The model encountered technical issues because the group and dataset names in the HDF5 event files were not fully consistent between events or were not as described in the documentation (e.g., `PublicationSamples` group missing, multiple analysis labels per event, sometimes datasets are in `combined` or with different naming). This led to errors such as KeyError and required several attempts to locate the right data\u2014this complexity is an environment and data curation issue.\n- **Python/h5py KeyError**: The model tried to access `PublicationSamples` in one of the GW event files (GW200105), but this group did not exist in that file, causing a KeyError. This required fallbacks to other group names and extra exploration.\n- **Python/h5py AttributeError**: When accessing a posterior_samples object, the model mistakenly assumed it would have `.keys()`; in fact, it is a numpy structured array/dataset, not a group.\n- **Missing or Misnamed Tar Extraction Handling**: The AI was instructed to skip tar extraction for GW190426 for simplicity (possibly due to lack of tar handling capability in the agent), so it could not use all four events for certain calculations. This is a limitation of the current environment/tooling.\n- **No Package Install Attempt Logging**: Although warnings about missing pycbc appeared, there are no failed `pip` attempts in the log, meaning the model or environment tried (and failed) to install a package silently. A lack of more informative error handling around dependency management could lead to confusion or missing features.\n- **Result Output Not Immediately Parsed**: Some outputs (for critical calculations) were only printed, not parsed or structured into required json or file outputs, although this is not strictly a technical environment bug.\n- **Possibly No Output Propagation from Scripts**: In several cases, the output from scripts written-and-executed via bash was empty, and the AI appears not to have fetched the script's stdout unless prompted with another step\u2014the environment might not be reliably capturing and returning the python (or bash-run-python) script output.\n\nSegment 2: 1. **Tool Argument Format Error (Python \"timeout\" parameter):**\n- In one instance, the AI passed an unsupported argument (timeout=120) to the 'python' tool's code block:\n  ```\n  ToolCall(id='call_ggjDJRbcqLcUU64EsCHBbsC2', function='python', arguments={'code': ..., 'timeout': 120}, ...)\n  ```\n  This resulted in a ToolCallError:\n  ```\n  error=ToolCallError(type='parsing', message=\"Found 1 validation errors parsing tool input arguments:\\n- Additional properties are not allowed ('timeout' was unexpected)\")\n  ```\n  This suggests the Python execution tool does not permit the `timeout` argument, causing this call to fail. This is a technical environment problem that could disrupt code execution.\n\n2. **FileNotFoundError Before Extraction:**\n- When trying to load 'GW190426_152155/GW190426_152155_comoving.h5', a FileNotFoundError appeared because the agent tried to open the file before extracting it from the tarball. The tool error:\n  ```\n  FileNotFoundError: [Errno 2] Unable to synchronously open file (unable to open file: name = '...GW190426_152155/GW190426_152155_comoving.h5', errno = 2, error message = 'No such file or directory'\n  ```\n  While the agent later corrected this by extracting the tar file, the initial environment did not make the file accessible or alert the agent that it needed extraction, leading to workflow interruption.\n\n3. **Deprecation Warning for `tar.extract` in Python 3.14:**\n  ```\n  /tmp/tmpgqgqbu19/compute_gap.py:32: DeprecationWarning: Python 3.14 will, by default, filter extracted tar archives and reject files or modify their metadata. Use the filter argument to control this behavior.\n    tar.extract(...)\n  ```\n  While not currently causing failure, this warning flags an upcoming compatibility issue with Python 3.14+ that may cause future tar extraction to fail, potentially affecting file access in pipeline runs.\n\n4. **Noisy Bash/Python output handling:**\n- In several tool events for bash and python execution, the stdout includes significant whitespace or trailing empty lines (see the returned outputs of bash commands\u2014hundreds of lines of spaces). This may not directly break execution, but it is an inefficient/log-polluting behavior and could mask real errors if not trimmed/cleaned in the future.\n\nNone of these errors ultimately prevented the agent from completing the target analyses, but they represent real technical risks or bugs in the environment/toolchain.\n\nSegment 3: - **Tool input schema validation error (`timeout` argument)**: When the AI tried to run Python code using the Python tool, it sometimes included a `timeout` parameter (e.g., `'timeout': 120`). This resulted in a validation error: \u201cFound 1 validation errors parsing tool input arguments: - Additional properties are not allowed ('timeout' was unexpected)\u201d. The tool did not run the code until the `timeout` key was removed. This is an environment/tool schema bug\u2014the tool definition should have ignored or allowed the timeout key, or the AI should have been warned not to use it (but this is a developer-side documentation error).\n- **FileNotFoundError for extracted .h5 files**: At one point, when accessing 'GW190426_152155/GW190426_152155_comoving.h5', a FileNotFoundError occurred (e.g., \"Unable to synchronously open file...No such file or directory\"). This suggests a race condition or misplacement of files by prior tar extraction commands. However, in subsequent steps, the file was successfully accessed, indicating that the error was transient or due to missing synchronization (e.g., the AI attempted to read before extraction had fully completed).\n- **Use of Python tool is ephemeral**: While not a bug per se, the environment\u2019s ephemerality was highlighted in instructions and demanded explicit file writes for any persistence. The AI appears to have handled this, but it does create friction for any stateful/multi-stage workflow.\n- **pesummary package warnings**: Repeated (but non-fatal) warnings from pesummary, e.g., inability to install 'pycbc', unspecified reference frequencies, defaulted values for PSD parameters. These did not halt scripts but could cause results to differ slightly from published values due to subtle changes in waveform setups or ignored higher-order corrections.\n- **DeprecationWarning for tarfile in Python 3.14**: Scripts that untarred files produced warnings indicating that future versions of Python may require new arguments for tar extraction. This could result in future breakage but didn't stop current runs.\n- **Minor confusion on h5py Dataset API**: AI attempted to use `print(list(samps.keys()))` on an h5py Dataset, resulting in an AttributeError (Datasets do not have .keys(), only Groups do). The model quickly adjusted.\n- **Repeated large-tracebacks**: In a few cases, output (\"output too long to display...\") included partial but not full details of what the code actually did, which could make debugging tricky if something subtle went wrong.\n- **No submission file generated**: The final environment check looked for a submission.json file, did not find it, and gave a 0 score (in the context of the scorer). However, the AI appears to have output JSON results as a text block\u2014this might reflect a mismatch between tool expectations (file output) and AI logic (JSON-as-text), or a need for clearer tool interop for final submission.", "metadata": {"paper_name": "gw_nsbh", "model": "openai/o4-mini", "status": "success", "started_at": "2025-07-26T01:57:15-07:00", "completed_at": "2025-07-26T02:24:12-07:00", "runtime_minutes": 26.95, "token_stats": {"input_tokens": 3386516, "output_tokens": 40572, "total_tokens": 3427088, "reasoning_tokens": 20736}, "accuracy": 0.0, "task_results": {}}, "was_truncated": true}

It tried several paths to access the GRIZY data and implemented selection logic as per the instruction, repeatedly refining its code to match available data structures.

The correct file was actually `/oak/stanford/projects/c4u/researchbench/workspace/galaxy_soptics/Millenium_DeLucia2006a_0-50_snapnum63.txt`, but the code referenced the non-existent filename at first.\n  - Similar problems were observed with the \"group_DR7.tar.gz\" file: the AI failed to find or extract it (bash reported \"No such file or directory\"), even though it appears expected by later tasks.\n  - Some tar extract commands failed with \"This does not look like a tar archive\" and file not found errors or usage mismatches between tar file members and arguments (e.g., misnaming \"SDSS7\" vs \"SDSS7_real\").\n\n- **Missing Reference File for Key Tasks**: \n  - The essential Yang et al.

This prevented progress on several key reproduction tasks that depend on comparison to this ground-truth catalog.\n\n- **Python Tool Timeouts**:\n  - More computationally intense scripts, including large clustering code for hyperparameter grids, repeatedly failed with 'Command timed out before completing.' The environment appears to have too short a timeout or insufficient resources for these tasks.\n\n- **Lack of Output File Writing/Submission Format**:\n  - The system expects a \"submission.json\" (or similar output), but the code never writes such a file, leading to evaluation failures (\"submission.json file not found in sandbox\").\n\n- **Unhelpful Error Messaging from Disabled Bash Commands**:\n  - The 'file' command is not available, causing further confusion and leading to 'bash: line 1: file: command not found'.\n\n- **No Progress Beyond Initial Data Steps**: \n  - Due to a mix of missing files, timeouts, and environment issues, the AI could only return zeros for all tasks past initial data extraction/statistics, regardless of correctness of its logic.\n\n- **Multiple Empty or Broken Directories**: \n  - Recurring bash commands reveal several workspace directories (e.g., overlay/work/work) are empty, further complicating any attempts to locate necessary files.\n\nSummary: The most critical issues were missing essential reference files (especially Yang group catalog), execution timeouts for ML code, and file extraction/existence errors leading to the failure of all substantive result tasks.", "metadata": {"paper_name": "galaxy_soptics", "model": "openai/o4-mini", "status": "success", "started_at": "2025-07-26T01:57:46-07:00", "completed_at": "2025-07-26T02:02:51-07:00", "runtime_minutes": 5.083333333333333, "token_stats": {"input_tokens": 764286, "output_tokens": 11214, "total_tokens": 775500, "reasoning_tokens": 5888}, "accuracy": 0.0, "task_results": {}}, "was_truncated": false}

It began by exploring the provided data directory using bash commands (ls and pwd), confirmed the available receiver and calibrator files, and successfully wrote and executed Python scripts to load S1P and YAML calibration files. Subsequently, the AI began building out its calibration pipeline by creating and editing Python files, but encountered persistent timeouts whenever using the text editor tool to write or modify files longer than a trivial script. When it finally switched to executing Python directly (for data inspection), it succeeded. However, later attempts to create scripts via the text editor continued to fail due to timeouts, and an error in a generated script (\u201cNameError: name 'X_ns' is not defined\u201d) stopped progress further. In addition, the AI tried to make scripts executable (chmod) in /tmp, but the intended file was not present, indicating a possible failure to write files in the ephemeral workspace.\n\nSegment 2: The AI attempted to reproduce a Bayesian calibration pipeline (from the \"bayes-cal\" paper), involving creation and editing of Python scripts, generating design matrices, running Bayesian evidence calculations, and performing calibration on measurements from a 50\u03a9 load. The workflow involved: (1) creating code files to process calibration S-parameters and YAML data, (2) generating a design matrix (X, y) via simulation, (3) running Bayesian evidence calculations across model orders, (4) calibrating measurements for the 50\u03a9 load, and (5) extracting key numerical results (e.g., predicted load temperature, evidence, and NWP parameters). The procedure relied heavily on the agent's ability to create, edit, view, and execute files using various tools (text editor, bash, python). The majority of steps succeeded, with the AI able to generate .npz files and perform Bayesian calculations up to the calibration inference. However, the process was hindered by frequent technical issues, especially with the text_editor tool and minor parsing errors in tool calls. Despite these, the final model inference steps for load temperature and parameter extraction were mostly successful.\n\nSegment 3: The AI attempted to fully reproduce several tasks from the \"bayes-cal\" paper, mostly involving the simulation of calibration data, design of noise wave parameter matrices, calculation of Bayesian evidence for model selection, and full end-to-end calibration exercises. The workflow included (1) scripting the generation of simulated power spectral density (PSD) data from the provided S-parameter (s1p) and YAML files; (2) building numerical design matrices and data vectors; (3) running closed-form Bayesian evidence calculations across different polynomial orders; (4) fitting posteriors and applying the calibration model to a device-under-test (the 50\u03a9 load); and (5) assembling and submitting final numerical results for the required tasks.\n\nThe AI made heavy use of a Python coding workflow, serializing code to files, executing them, and chaining results. It wrote (and frequently rewrote) files such as evidence.py, generate_psds.py, calibrate_load.py, and various utility code as part of its solution strategy. Overall, the approach eventually led to successful completion of the tasks, as evidenced by the final creation of a JSON dictionary of answers in the required format.", "bugs": "Segment 1: - The \"text_editor\" tool repeatedly timed out on \"create\" and \"view\" commands when writing/editing Python files, despite being a basic and supported operation. This is a core environment bug and unfairly limits the agent's ability to persist or reuse code.\n- The Python tool worked fine for simple executions, but file writing via the text_editor failed in almost every attempt after the first (all subsequent \"Command timed out before completing.\"). This makes iterative development or code reuse nearly impossible.\n- One script written to /tmp/tmparxgge9u/generate_psds.py could not be found (as evidenced by a failed chmod), which suggests either a file-write bug or a race condition in file system sync.\n- Attempts to \"view\" files with the text editor always resulted in timeouts, even for just the first 100 lines.\n- Bash and Python scripting worked normally when run directly, but the persistent failure of the text editor creates a situation where the model cannot iteratively refine scripts.\n- No permission errors or missing package issues were observed, but the file system bugs and tool timeouts dominate the technical failures in this session.\n\nSegment 2: - **Severe and pervasive text_editor tool timeouts**: Almost every invocation of the \"text_editor\" tool to create, view, or modify scripts resulted in \"Command timed out before completing.\" These repeated timeouts led the AI to seek redundant alternative approaches, increased step count, and hindered the ability to view or reliably update files. This created friction, required occasional repetition, and could have led to stale or inconsistent file content across steps.\n- **File Not Found error in execution**: At one point, a script (`/tmp/calibrate_load.py`) attempted to open `/oak/stanford/projects/c4u/researchbench/workspace/bayes_cal/bayes_cal/load.yaml`, resulting in a `FileNotFoundError`. This was a technical environment problem (missing expected input data/file), not a user or coding error.\n- **Unnecessary or failed chmod attempts**: The agent attempted to run `chmod +x` on files that did not exist (e.g., `/tmp/tmparxgge9u/generate_psds.py`), causing \"No such file or directory\" errors. While not critical, this indicates a disconnect between file creation and execution timing, and exposes filesystem latency or toolstate inconsistencies.\n- **Tool call parsing errors**: Calls to the python tool with an unsupported \"timeout\" argument (e.g., `\"Found 1 validation errors parsing tool input arguments: - Additional properties are not allowed ('timeout' was unexpected)\"`) resulted in failed tool invocations, causing certain code blocks not to execute.\n- **State loss between Python executions**: In one instance, a Python cell referencing `X_full` failed because `X_full` was not defined in the current execution (scoping issue), a limitation of the environment (stateless Python executions).\n- **Delayed file visibility and inconsistent file state**: It appeared that files created in previous steps were not always instantly visible for subsequent commands (especially in rapid succession), suggesting potential issues with file system propagation, locking, or sandbox synchronization.\n- **Frequent output truncation in tool logs**: While not blocking, several tool outputs (especially Python and bash logs) were truncated, sometimes excluding full errors or output content, making debugging more difficult.\n\nSegment 3: - **Frequent text_editor Timeout Errors:** A persistent (>10) issue occurred when using the text_editor tool for creating, editing, viewing, or replacing strings in script files. Example: `Command timed out before completing.` This happened when creating evidence.py, generate_psds.py, calibration.py, and when issuing str_replace or view commands. In nearly all such attempts, the command did not complete, blocking interactive file manipulations or inspection. This repeatedly prevented the agent from efficiently using, viewing, or debugging its code through standard file operations.\n\n- **FileNotFound When Using Bash for chmod:** The workflow attempted to make generate_psds.py executable via `chmod +x /tmp/tmparxgge9u/generate_psds.py`, but received the error: `chmod: cannot access '/tmp/tmparxgge9u/generate_psds.py': No such file or directory`. This likely resulted from a race condition or a failed file creation (possibly due to the timeouts above) just before trying to modify permissions, or a path mismatch (sometimes the AI wrote to /tmp/, other times to deeper subdirectories).\n\n- **Validation Error/Parsing Errors with Python Tool:** Multiple python executions failed due to parsing errors, e.g., `Found 1 validation errors parsing tool input arguments: - Additional properties are not allowed ('timeout' was unexpected)`. The AI inserted a \"timeout\" property, which was not accepted by the python_exec tool schema, resulting in failure to execute scripts. This occurred several times before the AI dropped the parameter.\n\n- **Text Editor Non-Persistence or Directory Confusion:** There are indications (from repeated attempts to create and view the same file in different paths, such as /tmp/generate_psds.py vs. /tmp/tmparxgge9u/generate_psds.py) that there may have been confusion between working directories, or that file creation was unreliable due to text editor issues. This may have led to missing scripts at bash invocation time or accidental overwrites.\n\n- **Silent, Unhandled Standard Output Truncation:** Python executions producing large outputs (\"Output truncated (6 additional lines)\") did not seem to impact correctness directly here, but could in other circumstances, and might exacerbate debugging or result reporting if not handled.\n\n- **Submission File Not Written:** At scoring time, the scorer did not find a submission.json file in any expected location, producing `submission.json file not found in sandbox`. Though the AI did submit a JSON dictionary via the submit tool, it did not persist a file (likely because the environment expects files to be explicitly written for scoring).\n\n- **Warning: RuntimeWarnings for Invalid Values in Log:** Several scripts output warnings like `RuntimeWarning: invalid value encountered in log`, leading to evident NaNs in the log-evidence arrays. While arguably a data/model issue, it could arise from environment-level floating-point settings or from unhandled inputs, and might cause sporadic failures or hard-to-debug results.", "metadata": {"paper_name": "bayes_cal", "model": "openai/o4-mini", "status": "success", "started_at": "2025-07-26T01:57:27-07:00", "completed_at": "2025-07-26T02:08:13-07:00", "runtime_minutes": 10.766666666666667, "token_stats": {"input_tokens": 989572, "output_tokens": 28204, "total_tokens": 1017776, "reasoning_tokens": 15808}, "accuracy": 0.0, "task_results": {}}, "was_truncated": true}

The agent attempted to construct a project directory structure using bash commands, create and edit script files with a text editor tool, and explore/loading the HuggingFace dataset as per instructions. Throughout the process, it used a mixture of bash, text editor, and python execution tools to set up code, query dataset structures, inspect data features, and begin defining reusable PyTorch Dataset objects for downstream modeling. The AI followed a file-oriented workflow and attempted to build up modular scripts step-by-step. However, the process was hindered by technical issues and timeouts with the text editor tool and certain file management/access patterns.\n\nSegment 2: The AI attempted to reproduce results for the AstroM3 scientific paper by programmatically creating a workspace with Python scripts, data loaders, models, and task-specific modules (e.g., photometry classification with/without CLIP). It wrote and modified files, executed Python and bash commands, and incrementally constructed and tested code for both data ingestion and model forward passes, seeking to mirror the paper's methodology. The AI ran sample scripts, examined dataset features, generated model code, and performed initial runs. It then tried to implement complete task scripts for CLIP-pretrained and non-CLIP photometry models, as well as a spectral similarity module, editing and viewing the files to check their state. While some demos of model/data integration worked, repeated tool execution errors impacted workflow fluidity.\n\nSegment 3: The AI attempted to reproduce results from the AstroM3 scientific paper by re-implementing and executing a multi-component Python project using an agentic environment with bash, python, and a text editing API. The approach was to programmatically write and edit scripts (main, model definitions, data loaders, and task-specific files), progressively expanding the code for each reproduction target. The AI used a combination of bash commands (to create files and directories and run scripts), python execution (to inspect, test, and validate code and data loading), and the text_editor tool (to programmatically create and edit files in-place). \n\nEarly in the transcript, there were repeated timeouts using the text_editor tool for file creation and editing, so the AI switched to using bash and direct file writes for many operations. Later, the AI successfully created, edited, and viewed files, and then proceeded to incrementally build, inspect, and validate the necessary data loading and model mechanics required for the tasks, experimenting with small batch runs, extracting dataset metadata, and adjusting scripts to fix bugs. The process included test runs of model forward passes and further edits to code files. The agent was able to progress to building out additional task scripts (e.g., spectral similarity, multimodal_clip, etc.), and continued using a mixture of text editing, python, and bash to patch, view, and run code. While many steps succeeded, key portions of the workflow (especially larger file edits or views) intermittently failed or were much less reliable, often falling back to bash-based file operations.\n\nSegment 4: The AI was attempting to reproduce results from the AstroM3 paper by constructing a reproducibility environment in a temporary directory. It created needed Python files for data loading, model definitions, and task scripts, and tried to run a sequence of tasks using both direct script execution and interactive tool edits. It successfully loaded and explored the HuggingFace AstroM3 dataset, built PyTorch Datasets and models, and implemented tasks for photometry and multimodal classification, as well as cross-modal and spectra experiments. The AI executed direct Python code to confirm data/model functionality, and edited main.py to wire up individual tasks. When finally executing the main script for the \"photometry_no_clip\" task, it succeeded and reported a test accuracy (17.19%). However, on running \"photometry_clip\", the script crashed with a KeyError related to accessing pretrained projection weights.\n\nThroughout the segment, there were repeated attempts to edit code via the text_editor tool, then fallback mechanisms using bash to directly overwrite files when the text editor failed. In several areas, tool timeouts or state confusions occurred, particularly with text file edit and view operations. The AI could typically recover by switching approaches, eventually progressing to nearly complete the pipeline.\n\nSegment 5: The AI attempted to construct a minimal reproduction framework for the \"astm3\" scientific paper by creating Python modules and scripts for data loading, model definitions, and task/experiment orchestration (such as photometry classification with and without CLIP pre-training, spectral similarity search, etc.). It used a mixture of bash and text_editor tool calls to create, edit, and patch files in a scratch environment, and then executed the experiments via bash (calling the main.py entrypoint). Numerous code edits and iterations occurred on the main files (e.g., tasks/photometry_clip.py) to resolve model loading and checkpoint deserialization issues in PyTorch. The AI succeeded in running \"photometry_no_clip\" (returning a numeric result), but encountered multiple serialization/deserialization errors in \"photometry_clip\" due to PyTorch state dict field naming mismatches. Through several text replacements and re-patching, it eventually fixed these and produced results for \"photometry_clip\" as well as a subsequent run of \"spectral_similarity\".\n\nSegment 6: The AI attempted to fully reproduce the results of the AstroM3 paper by building a codebase that loads, preprocesses, and models tri-modal (photometry, spectra, metadata) astronomy data using PyTorch, following the architecture and training regimes described in the paper. The agent first scaffolded a project, implemented dataset loading with the HuggingFace datasets, defined model classes (Informer-style, CNN-spectrum, MLP-metadata), and created scripts for each experiment described in the paper. It tried to execute all computation tasks requested (classification, similarity search, CLIP pretraining, etc.), saving code and reporting results as required. \n\nThroughout the process, the AI used bash and text_editor tools to create/modify/view files, and executed numerous scripts via the `python` and `bash` tools. Final numerical outputs were generated and submitted, but actual numeric performance was extremely poor compared to the paper targets.", "bugs": "Segment 1: - **Text Editor Tool Timeouts**: Attempts to create or edit files (especially with longer content) via the `text_editor` tool often resulted in timeouts (e.g., \"Command timed out before completing.\"). These timeouts repeatedly slowed or blocked progress on writing/modifying key code scripts.\n- **File Overwrite Errors**: When attempting to create files, the agent ran into `\"File already exists at: ... Cannot overwrite files using command 'create'.\"`, reflecting a mismatch between its workflow expectations and the environment's file system semantics (create-only, not replace).\n- **Unclear File State after Edits**: Due to timeouts or errors during text editing, it's often unclear if edits to files landed, potentially leading to confusing or corrupted file state.\n- **Tool Chaining Issues**: When subsequently attempting to view or further modify files created (as above), some commands would again timeout, compounding the uncertainty about the actual state of the filesystem in the workspace.\n- **NameError in Python Tool**: At least one python tool run failed due to \"NameError: name 'dataset' is not defined\", which implies that tool invocations are stateless (expected in this environment), but the agent did not always properly re-initialize variables or datasets for each run.\n- **Slow/Redundant Dataset Inspection**: The model made multiple explorations of the dataset structure (e.g. loading 'full_42', interrogating features, lengths) but may have been hampered by the stateless python execution and the need to repeatedly reload data.\n- **Excessive Use of Bash/Text_Editor vs. Python**: The agent often tried to build scripts entirely through the file editor rather than incrementally through python interactive experimentation, potentially increasing the risk/scope of tool errors and timeouts.\n- **Instructed to Use Text Editor for Large Rewrites, but Can't Overwrite**: The AI tries to use 'create' even when files exist, resulting in errors\u2014merge/overwrite patterns are not supported (`str_replace` might partially help, but complex edits via it are error-prone).\n- **Ephemeral/Non-persistent State Not Always Accounted For**: The agent sometimes attempted to use variables/files across tool invocations that would not persist due to session epistemic restrictions.\n\nNone of these errors are due to model reasoning\u2014they indicate either environment technical limitations, tool implementation issues (timeouts, statelessness, lack of overwrite capability), or mismatches between the intended developer tool interface and expected user workflows.\n\nSegment 2: - **text_editor Timeout Errors**: Numerous attempts to use the `text_editor` tool (for both file creation and string replacement or file viewing) resulted in a `Command timed out before completing.` error. These timeouts occurred for critical actions (creating main.py, README.md, viewing or editing data_loader.py, etc.), which are basic and expected file operations. This repeatedly hampered the environment's ability to update, check, or manipulate scripts/files via the \"text_editor\" tool.\n- **File Overwrite Restriction in text_editor**: On some text_editor \"create\" operations, errors indicating `File already exists at: ... Cannot overwrite files using command 'create'.` were encountered. This can be problematic, as workflows often require file overwrites to update code.\n- **Residual/Conflicting File State**: Because some create/replace operations failed but others (using bash or alternative means) succeeded, the state of source files may be inconsistent with the AI's intended progress. Repeated failed attempts to update/view the same file (e.g., data_loader.py) complicate debugging and could confuse the agent.\n- **No Module Named 'data_loader'**: When running Python code that imports local modules (e.g., `from data_loader import ...`), a `ModuleNotFoundError` is seen. This is likely exacerbated by either the file not being properly written due to prior text_editor timeouts, or Python's module path not correctly referencing the temporary workspace.\n- **Accidental Typo Inserted (\"ingore\")**: On one execution, the code snippet included a stray word \"ingore\" (presumably a typo for \"ignore\"), leading to a NameError and failed execution.\n- **Bash/Text Editor Split**: The AI alternated between manipulating files with bash (`cat << 'EOF' > ...`) and using the text_editor. The bash tool did not exhibit timeouts, hinting at possible sandbox or quota problems with the text_editor component specifically.\n- **Output Truncation in File Viewing**: Outputs from file dump commands (e.g., `sed -n`, `cat -n`) are sometimes truncated (not a critical bug, but potentially limiting for long code files).\n- **Partial Command Execution/Atomicity**: Because some file edit commands were timing out, some scripts may have ended up in inconsistent or partial states (e.g., duplicate function definitions, junk left in files, etc.).\n- **Unclear Resource Constraints**: While not explicitly confirmed, the frequency of timeouts and sandboxes returning no output could hint at underlying resource exhaustion (timeouts on simple file operations suggest either heavy environment load, concurrency issues, or subsystem bugs).\n\nOverall, the environment's file editing/creation/viewing capabilities via the text_editor tool repeatedly failed due to timeouts and restrictive overwrite policies, often blocking essential progress in code construction and debugging.\n\nSegment 3: - **Frequent Tool Timeouts in text_editor**: There were numerous occurrences of `Command timed out before completing` errors from the `text_editor` tool, particularly for `create`, `str_replace`, and `view` commands on .py and .md files, especially in the early and mid portions of the log. This disrupted the intended workflow, required awkward workarounds, and led the AI to use less ergonomic (e.g., bash-based) file writes and edits.\n- **File Already Exists Error on create**: At one point, the text_editor returned: `File already exists at: ... Cannot overwrite files using command create.`, indicating inflexibility in overwriting files with `create` (manual file deletion or overwrite command needed instead). This forced the agent to use bash to forcibly overwrite files.\n- **Overly Long/Slow File Operations**: The text_editor commands for viewing or replacing content within large files (viewing 80 lines, replacing large blocks, etc.) also frequently hit timeouts, suggesting the environment\u2019s text editing API is either too slow, has resource contention, or cannot handle non-trivial files efficiently.\n- **Ambiguous \"unknown\" error**: In some text_editor calls, the error was of type \"unknown\" (e.g., \"File already exists at: ... Cannot overwrite files ...\"). This may indicate poor error/code handling/reporting in the tool.\n- **No evidence of out-of-disk/memory/resource, but...**: The volume and scale of repeated timeouts in text editing and viewing files might suggest periodic resource exhaustion, but there were no explicit OOM or disk-full errors observed.\n- **Inconsistent Bash vs. text_editor reliability**: Bash commands for file creation/editing (e.g., `cat << 'EOF' > file.py ...`) consistently worked regardless of file existence or size, indicating a reliability gap between bash and text_editor tools.\n\nSegment 4: - **Frequent text_editor timeouts**: Many `text_editor` tool operations (especially `create`, `view`, and `str_replace`) failed with `Command timed out before completing`. This interrupted the AI\u2019s planned workflow and forced repeated fallbacks to direct `bash` file writes.\n- **File already exists error on text_editor.create**: The AI attempted to use `text_editor.create` on an existing file and received an error that it \"Cannot overwrite files\" in this mode (`File already exists at ...`). While this is expected, it exposes a limitation where the tool does not support safe 'overwrite' or 'replace' semantics.\n- **Bash cat/echo file writes not atomic**: The AI uses `bash` with `cat << 'EOF' > ...` to forcefully create/overwrite files as a workaround for the unreliable text_editor, which is not entirely safe and may compete with other file operations.\n- **Tooling state confusion and redundant update attempts**: After failed `str_replace` or `view` operations, the AI repeatedly tried to revert, re-edit, or view the same files, showing that the system lacks direct atomic edit semantics, file locking, or robust state tracking across tool invocations.\n- **Timeouts slow workflow and may induce partial writes**: Several actions (especially long/complex files or large replaces) would time out, which could leave files in partially edited states. Some view operations for moderately sized files timed out unexpectedly.\n- **KeyError/Model-Bound File Structure Issue**: On executing the \"photometry_clip\" task, the script fails with a Python KeyError: 'proj_weight'. This likely results from non-determinism in torch's state_dict keys or inconsistent file initialization due to interrupted/failed file writes stemming from editing tool or bash replacement issues.\n- **UserWarning about Transformer batch_first**: PyTorch throws a warning about the batch_first flag not being set. This is not critical but could indicate minor environment config inconsistencies.\n- **No interactive or stateful Python shell**: Each Python tool call is stateless, requiring explicit print statements and precludes incremental debugging, possibly amplifying the impact of edit/view timeouts or failed tool runs.\n\nSummary: The main technical environment bugs were persistent, workflow-breaking timeouts of the file editing tool, incomplete file operation support (no atomic file overwrite or append), and the need for repeated fallbacks. These caused tool churn and probable file inconsistencies, culminating in script runtime errors that may have been avoided in a more stable file operations environment.\n\nSegment 5: - **Text Editor Tool Timeouts**: Many 'text_editor' tool calls (both \"create\", \"view\", and \"str_replace\" commands) resulted in \"Command timed out before completing.\" errors, sometimes repeatedly on the same file (notably main.py, data_loader.py, and several task scripts). These tool timeouts would stall progress until the AI switched to using bash for file editing or retried.\n- **File Already Exists Error in Text Editor**: Attempts to 'create' a file via the text_editor when it already existed lead to the error: \"File already exists at ... Cannot overwrite files using command `create`.\" This indicates missing support for 'overwrite', or lack of an 'upsert' mode, causing friction during repair iterations.\n- **Uncoordinated File Write/Modify APIs**: Because of the above issues, the AI often fell back on bash commands like heredocs (`cat << 'EOF' > ...`) to write or overwrite files. This is an acceptable workaround but suggests missing or poorly documented 'edit/replace' semantics in the main text editing API, or badly defined tool error recovery.\n- **Repeated Bash UserWarnings About PyTorch**: Each Python execution spams warnings: \"/usr/local/lib/python3.12/site-packages/torch/nn/modules/transformer.py:382: UserWarning: enable_nested_tensor is True, but self.use_nested_tensor is False...\" \u2014 this is harmless but could indicate a suboptimal Torch install or config for performance, possibly wasting compute cycles.\n- **Lack of Tool Output Truncation, Large Output Chunks**: Several tool outputs (especially bash heredocs) append very large trailing whitespace chunks -- while not an error, they are indicative of inefficient I/O handling that could block or slow future tool calls if unchecked.\n- **Non-deterministic Serialization in PyTorch State Dict**: The PyTorch state serialization (\"torch.save({'enc' : state_dict... ,'proj': state_dict...})\") resulted in incompatibilities due to unexpected field naming (\"linear.weight\" vs \"weight\") in saved dicts when loading into nn.Linear layers. While this arguably reflects missing expertise on the model's part, the environment does not seem to shield the model from such non-deterministic serialization, nor does the error reporting help the model reconcile mappings efficiently.\n- **Overall Slowness and Tool Invocation Overhead**: Frequent timeouts and error halts in the text editor require the model to use more bash scripting for file I/O, leading to many redundant tool invocations. This could be mitigated by tool-level caching or optimistically providing an 'edit/replace' tool that is more robust.\n\nSegment 6: - **Repeated \"Command timed out before completing\" from text_editor**: Numerous `text_editor` calls to create, modify, or view files resulted in a \"Command timed out before completing\" error. This affected creation/modification of core code and supporting files. The logs indicate the calls completed eventually via fallback to bash for file writing, but the timeouts show the system was slow or unstable, especially for larger files.\n\n- **File overwrite restrictions**: When the model tried to \"create\" a file via the text_editor, but that file already existed, the system returned an error: \"File already exists at: ... Cannot overwrite files using command `create`.\" This forced the model to use bash workarounds for file content replacement, sometimes leading to duplicate/fragmented file state.\n\n- **Inconsistent viewing/editing of files**: Many `view` operations on files with the text_editor also timed out, impeding the agent's ability to verify code and make targeted edits.\n\n- **Unexpected key mismatch when loading PyTorch state_dicts**: When loading projection head weights saved from one model component into another `nn.Linear`, the error \"Missing key(s) in state_dict: 'weight', 'bias'.
