    "description": "Calculate the root mean square (RMS) median age difference score comparing the modeled and observed age-[O/Fe] relation for the Early-burst SFH combined with the Plateau (W=1 Gyr) DTD.",
    "instructions": "Load the multi-zone model output corresponding to the Early-burst star formation history (SFH) and the Plateau delay-time distribution (DTD) with W=1 Gyr from the provided dataset (`multizone.tar.gz`). Also load the APOGEE observational sample (`sample.csv`) including the Leung et al. (2023) ages, and apply the selection cuts specified in Table 1, including the age uncertainty cut ($\\sigma_{Age} / Age < 40\\%$). For both the model output and the observational data, divide the stars into the 18 Galactic regions defined by bins in R_gal (3-5, 5-7, 7-9, 9-11, 11-13, 13-15 kpc) and |z| (0-0.5, 0.5-1, 1-2 kpc). Apply Gaussian scatter to the model [O/Fe] values based on the median observational uncertainty (0.019 dex) and to the model log(Age/Gyr) values based on the median observational uncertainty (0.10 dex), both from Table 4. Convert log(Age) to Age in Gyr. Within each Galactic region, bin the stars by [O/Fe] with a bin width of 0.05 dex. Calculate the difference between the mass-weighted median age in the model ($\tau_{VICE}$) and the median stellar age from the observations ($\tau_{L23}$) in each bin k ($\\Delta\tau_k$). Compute the RMS median age difference for the region using Equation 14 (Equation 16 in the PDF version), weighting by the number of observed stars in each bin ($n_{L23,k}$). Compute the final score S as the average $\\Delta\tau_{RMS}$ across all regions, weighted by the total number of observed stars with age measurements in each region.",

The value is 0.747 Gyr.",
