    "description": "Calculate the median delay time for the 'Plateau' delay-time distribution (DTD) model with specific parameters.",
    "instructions": "Implement the 'Plateau' DTD functional form given by Equation 6. Use the parameters specified in Table 2 for the second 'Plateau' model: plateau width W = 1 Gyr and power-law slope alpha = -1.1. The DTD is defined for delay times t >= t_D = 40 Myr up to t_max = 13.2 Gyr. Normalize the DTD according to Equation 5, using the total number of SNe Ia per M_sun (N_Ia/M_star) from Table 1. Calculate the median delay time (t_med), defined as the time at which the cumulative distribution function of the normalized DTD equals 0.5 * (N_Ia/M_star). Report the median delay time in Gyr. You may need numerical integration or root-finding.",
