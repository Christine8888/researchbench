    "description": "Calculate the Kullback-Leibler divergence score comparing the modeled and observed [O/Fe] distributions for the Inside-Out SFH combined with the Exponential (tau=1.5 Gyr) DTD.",
    "instructions": "Load the multi-zone model output corresponding to the Inside-Out star formation history (SFH) and the Exponential delay-time distribution (DTD) with tau=1.5 Gyr from the provided dataset (`multizone.tar.gz`). Also load the APOGEE observational sample (`sample.csv`) and apply the selection cuts specified in Table 1. For both the model output and the observational data, divide the stars into the 18 Galactic regions defined by bins in R_gal (3-5, 5-7, 7-9, 9-11, 11-13, 13-15 kpc) and |z| (0-0.5, 0.5-1, 1-2 kpc). For each region, generate the [O/Fe] probability distribution function (PDF) for the model (Q) and the observations (P). Apply Gaussian scatter to the model [O/Fe] values based on the median observational uncertainty (0.019 dex, from Table 4) before creating the PDF. Calculate the Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence D_KL(P||Q) for the [O/Fe] distributions in each region using Equation 11, numerically integrating with a step size d[O/Fe] = 0.01 dex. Compute the final score S as the average D_KL across all regions, weighted by the number of APOGEE stars in each region, as described by Equation 12.",
