    "description": "Calculate the characteristic radial migration distance scale sigma_RM for a specific stellar population age and formation radius using the paper's adopted formula.",
    "instructions": "Use Equation 9 from Appendix B to calculate the radial migration scale sigma_RM. Use the parameters provided in the text associated with Equation 9: sigma_RM8 = 2.68 kpc, age tau = 8 Gyr, and formation radius R_form = 8 kpc. Report the result in kpc.",

    "tolerance": 0.01,
    "output_justification": "Equation 9 in Appendix B defines sigma_RM as a function of age and R_form. The value sigma_RM8 = 2.68 kpc is explicitly defined as the value of sigma_RM for tau=8 Gyr and R_form=8 kpc.",
