    "instructions": "1. Download the simulated gravitational wave event data from https://zenodo.org/records/13363108\n2. Implement the Power Law + Peak model as defined in Appendix A (Eq. A2) of the paper\n3. Set up a hierarchical Bayesian inference framework using Equation 1 from the paper for the likelihood\n4. Implement the conversion between luminosity distance and redshift for a flat Î›CDM cosmology\n5. Account for selection effects using the detection probability calculation described in the paper\n6. Use a probabilistic programming framework (such as numpyro, pymc, etc.) for sampling\n7. Sample from the posterior distribution of H0 and the population hyperparameters\n8. Generate at least 1000 posterior samples after warm-up\n9. Calculate the 68.3% credible interval on H0 from the posterior samples\n10. Report the statistical uncertainty as a percentage of the true H0 value (67.66 km/s/Mpc)\n11. Present the final result as a single float representing the percentage uncertainty",
