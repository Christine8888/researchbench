Implement a non-parametric Gaussian process model for the mass distribution as described in previous tasks\n3. Set up the hierarchical Bayesian inference to simultaneously fit for H0 and ΩM\n4. Use uniform priors on both H0 and ΩM\n5. Run the inference to generate posterior samples of (H0, ΩM)\n6. Generate at least 1000 posterior samples after warm-up\n7. Compute the marginalized posterior distribution of H0 by creating a histogram of the H0 samples\n8. Find the peak of this marginalized distribution (the mode of the posterior)\n9. Present the final result as a single float representing the H0 value in km/s/Mpc at the peak of the posterior",
