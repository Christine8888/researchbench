    "instructions": "1. Download the required data files from https://zenodo.org/records/13363108\n2. Implement a simulation pipeline for gravitational wave events using the Power Law + Peak model with parameters: α = -2.7, mmax = 78 M⊙, mmin = 10 M⊙, μ = 30 M⊙, σ = 7.0 M⊙, fpeak = 0.05\n3. For the redshift distribution, use parameters: zp = 2.4, αz = 1.0, βz = 3.4\n4. Use cosmological parameters: H0 = 67.66 km/s/Mpc, ΩM = 0.3, ΩΛ = 0.7\n5. Apply O5 LIGO selection effects with single-detector SNR threshold ρobs > 8 (refer to Appendix A in the paper for details)\n6. Generate source masses and redshifts according to the distributions described in Appendix A (Eq. A1-A3)\n7. Convert these to detector-frame masses and luminosity distances\n8. Apply detector selection effects to determine which events would be detected\n9. Count and return the total number of detected events as an integer value",
