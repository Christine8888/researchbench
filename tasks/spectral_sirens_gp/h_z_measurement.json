    "instructions": "1. Download the simulated gravitational wave data from https://zenodo.org/records/13363108\n2. Implement a non-parametric Gaussian process model for the mass distribution as described in Task 3\n3. Extend the inference framework to simultaneously fit for both H0 and ΩM cosmological parameters\n4. Use uniform priors on both H0 and ΩM\n5. Implement the flat ΛCDM cosmology formula to calculate the expansion rate at any redshift z given H0 and ΩM\n6. For each posterior sample of (H0, ΩM), calculate the value of H(z=0.9)\n7. Account for selection effects in the hierarchical Bayesian inference\n8. Generate at least 1000 posterior samples after warm-up\n9. Calculate the 68.3% credible interval width on H(z=0.9)\n10. Report the statistical uncertainty as a percentage of the true H(z=0.9) value\n11. Present the final result as a single float representing the percentage uncertainty",
