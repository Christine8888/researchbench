    "instructions": "1. Download the simulated gravitational wave data from https://zenodo.org/records/13363108\n2. Generate or use at least 10 different simulated gravitational wave catalogs\n3. Implement the Power Law + Peak model with the same parameters used to generate the data: α = -2.7, mmax = 78 M⊙, mmin = 10 M⊙, μ = 30 M⊙, σ = 7.0 M⊙, fpeak = 0.05\n4. For each catalog:\n   a. Set up a hierarchical Bayesian inference using Equation 1 from the paper\n   b. Infer the posterior distribution of H0 using the Power Law + Peak model\n   c. Calculate the posterior mean and standard deviation of H0\n   d. Determine if the inferred H0 differs from the true value (67.66 km/s/Mpc) by more than 1σ\n5. Calculate the percentage of catalogs for which the Power Law + Peak model produces an over- or under-estimate of H0 at greater than 1σ significance\n6. Present the final result as a single float representing the percentage of biased catalogs",

    "output_justification": "The paper states on page 9 that the Power Law + Peak model reaches the same level of bias (over- or under-estimate of H0 at greater than 1σ) only 26% of the time, showing a much lower bias rate than the Broken Power Law model."
