    "instructions": "1. Download the simulated gravitational wave event data from https://zenodo.org/records/13363108\n2. Implement a non-parametric Gaussian process model for the mass distribution with:\n   a. Matérn kernel with ν = 5/2\n   b. Appropriate priors on the kernel hyperparameters (length scale and variance)\n3. Set up a hierarchical Bayesian inference framework using Equations 1 & 2 for the likelihood\n4. Implement the conversion between luminosity distance and redshift for a flat ΛCDM cosmology\n5. Account for selection effects as described in the paper\n6. Use a sampling method such as Hamiltonian Monte Carlo (HMC) with No-U-Turn Sampler\n7. For computational efficiency, use a quasi-separable solver approach for the Gaussian process\n8. Generate at least 1000 posterior samples after warm-up\n9. Calculate the 68.3% credible interval on H0 from the posterior samples\n10. Report the statistical uncertainty as a percentage of the true H0 value (67.66 km/s/Mpc)\n11. Present the final result as a single float representing the percentage uncertainty",
