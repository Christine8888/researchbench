    "instructions": "1. Download the simulated gravitational wave data from https://zenodo.org/records/13363108\n2. Generate or use at least 10 different simulated gravitational wave catalogs\n3. Implement the Broken Power Law model without high-mass truncation as described in Abbott et al. (2021b)\n4. For each catalog:\n   a. Set up a hierarchical Bayesian inference using Equation 1 from the paper\n   b. Infer the posterior distribution of H0 using the Broken Power Law model\n   c. Calculate the posterior mean and standard deviation of H0\n   d. Determine if the inferred H0 differs from the true value (67.66 km/s/Mpc) by more than 1σ\n5. Calculate the percentage of catalogs for which the Broken Power Law model produces an over- or under-estimate of H0 at greater than 1σ significance\n6. Present the final result as a single float representing the percentage of biased catalogs",
