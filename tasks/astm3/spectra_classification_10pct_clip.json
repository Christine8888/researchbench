    "instructions": "1. Load the dataset containing photometric time-series, spectra, metadata, and class labels for the 10 variable star classes specified in Table 1.\n2. Create a 10% subset of the training data by downsampling the most common classes to ensure a balanced distribution, as described in Section 5.2 and Table 3. Use the corresponding validation and test sets.\n3. Preprocess the photometric time-series, spectra, and metadata as described in Sections 4.1, 4.2, and 4.3 respectively.\n4. Implement the full AstroM3 architecture (Informer Encoder, modified GalSpecNet, MLP, projection heads) as described in Section 4.\n5. Perform the AstroM3 self-supervised pre-training using the trimodal contrastive loss on the full dataset (excluding labels) as described in Section 4.4. Alternatively, load pre-trained AstroM3 weights.\n6. Extract the pre-trained weights for the spectra model (modified GalSpecNet).\n7. Add a fully connected classification head to the spectra encoder.\n8. Initialize the spectra encoder with the pre-trained weights and fine-tune the model on the classification task using the labels from the 10% training subset and a standard cross-entropy loss. Use the training setup described in Appendix A.\n9. Evaluate the model's classification accuracy on the test set corresponding to the 10% split. Report the average accuracy across 5 random seeds/data splits.",
