    "instructions": "1. Load the dataset containing photometric time-series, spectra, metadata, and class labels for the 10 variable star classes specified in Table 1.\n2. Preprocess the photometric time-series, spectra, and metadata as described in Sections 4.1, 4.2, and 4.3 respectively (normalization, scaling, feature engineering, cropping/padding, resampling, etc.).\n3. Implement the full AstroM3 architecture: Informer Encoder for photometry, modified GalSpecNet for spectra, MLP for metadata, and projection heads mapping to a shared 512-dim space (Section 4).\n4. Perform the AstroM3 self-supervised pre-training using the trimodal contrastive loss (symmetric cross-entropy on pairwise cosine similarity matrices) as described in Section 4.4 on the full dataset (excluding labels).\n5. Extract the pre-trained weights for the photometry Informer Encoder.\n6. Add a fully connected classification head to the photometry encoder.\n7. Initialize the photometry encoder with the pre-trained weights and fine-tune the model on the classification task using the provided labels and a standard cross-entropy loss. Use the training setup described in Appendix A.\n8. Evaluate the model's classification accuracy on the test set. Report the average accuracy across 5 random seeds/data splits.",
