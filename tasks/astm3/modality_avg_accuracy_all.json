    "instructions": "1. Follow steps 1-8 from the `multimodal_classification_clip` task to train and obtain predictions for the test set using the fine-tuned model with all three modalities combined.\n2. Calculate the classification accuracy for each of the 10 classes individually.\n3. Compute the simple average of the 10 per-class accuracies. Report this average value.",
