  "instructions": "Create a simulated image of a lensed galaxy with the following configuration: SIE lens (Einstein radius = 1.2 arcsec, axis ratio = 0.7, position angle = 45 degrees), Sérsic lens light (effective radius = 0.8 arcsec, Sérsic index = 4, magnitude = 18), Sérsic source (effective radius = 0.2 arcsec, Sérsic index = 1, magnitude = 20, centered at (0.1, 0.05) arcsec). Add Gaussian noise with sigma = 0.05. Using lenstronomy's fitting sequence, perform a joint fit of the lens mass, lens light, and source light parameters. Report the fractional error in the recovered Einstein radius, defined as |θE_true - θE_fit|/θE_true.",
