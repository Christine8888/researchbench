  "description": "Demonstrate the mass-sheet transformation (MST) degeneracy and its effect on time delays.",
  "instructions": "Create a lens model with a power-law elliptical mass distribution (Einstein radius = 1.0 arcsec, power-law slope gamma = 2.0, axis ratio = 0.7). Place a source at (0.1, 0.1) arcsec to produce multiple images. Apply a mass-sheet transformation with lambda = 0.9 to create a transformed model that produces identical image positions. Calculate the ratio of time delays between the original and transformed models. This ratio should match the theoretical prediction of lambda. Report the computed ratio of time delays (original/transformed) for the image pair with the largest time delay.",
