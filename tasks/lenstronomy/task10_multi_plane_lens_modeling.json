  "description": "Compute the effective Einstein radius of a multi-plane lens system.",
  "instructions": "Create a multi-plane lens system with two lenses: a main lens SIE (Einstein radius = 1.0 arcsec, axis ratio = 0.8) at z_lens1 = 0.5 and a secondary lens SIS (Einstein radius = 0.3 arcsec) at z_lens2 = 1.0, with a source at z_source = 2.0. Place the secondary lens at an angular offset of (0.5, 0.5) arcsec from the main lens. Use lenstronomy's multi-plane functionality to calculate the effective Einstein radius of this system, defined as the radius from the center of the main lens where the average convergence equals 1. Report the effective Einstein radius in arcseconds.",
