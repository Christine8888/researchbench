  "description": "Infer the Hubble constant from a simulated strong lensing system with time delays.",
  "instructions": "Create a simulated lens system with a composite mass model consisting of a power-law elliptical mass distribution (Einstein radius = 1.2 arcsec, power-law slope = 2.1, axis ratio = 0.8) and an external shear (gamma_ext = 0.05, phi_ext = 60 degrees). Place a point source representing a lensed quasar at (0.12, 0.08) arcsec from the lens center. Assume z_lens = 0.5 and z_source = 1.5. Using a true H0 value of 70 km/s/Mpc (Ωm = 0.3, ΩΛ = 0.7), calculate the time delays between the images. Then, using only the image positions and the calculated time delays as 'observed' quantities, recover H0 using lenstronomy's time-delay cosmography module. Report the median H0 value from the posterior distribution in km/s/Mpc.",
