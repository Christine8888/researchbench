Given the ‘eventfiles_table.csv’ file from https://huggingface.co/datasets/StevenDillmann/chandra_xray_eventfiles, reproduce the 2D-AE embedding space from the paper: 1) Build the E-t maps (2D eventfile representations) as detailed in the paper (normalize the histogram values here). 2) Apply the trained encoder rom the Github repo https://github.com/StevenDillmann/ml-xraytransients-mnras/blob/main/encoders/encoder_et.h5  (feature extraction). 3) Apply tsne with given hyperparameters in the paper (dimensionality reduction). 4) Write the resulting embedding vectors to a new file file called 2DAE_embedding.csv with the columns tsne1, tsne2, obsreg_id. 5) Submit only the full path to the file.",
