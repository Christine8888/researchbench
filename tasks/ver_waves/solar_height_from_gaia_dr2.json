  "description": "Determine the Sun's height above the Galactic mid-plane by analyzing the vertical stellar distribution in Gaia DR2 data using a symmetric density model.",
  "instructions": "This task determines an initial value for the Sun's height ($z_\\odot$) above the Galactic mid-plane using a symmetric density model. Use the existing Gaia DR2 dataset with cuts in distance and magnitude called gdr2_MS.fits. The core of the analysis involves preparing main-sequence stellar samples within distinct $G_{BP}-G_{RP}$ color slices. Follow the same procedure for this sample selection and refinement, including $M_G$ calculation, the use of Gaussian fits to isolate main-sequence stars (e.g., $\\pm 2\\sigma$ cuts), and the determination of completeness heights ($h$), as done in Sections 2 and 3. Once these per-color-slice samples are prepared, fit the two-component symmetric density model, $N(z) = N_0 [ \\text{sech}^2((z + z_\\odot)/(2H_1)) + f \\cdot \\text{sech}^2((z + z_\\odot)/(2H_2)) ]$ (Section 3), to the $z$-binned stellar number counts for each slice using the same bins as the paper. Use the same procedure as in Section 3.1 to get the model parameters. Finally, combine the $z_\\odot$ estimates from all color slices by calculating their mean. The uncertainty of this overall mean $z_\\odot$ should be estimated using a bootstrapping technique, following the method described at the end of Section 3.1. Return a list of two numbers: the mean $z_\\odot$ in parsecs and its bootstrapped uncertainty.",
  "tolerance": [0.1, 0.1],
  "expected_output": [20.3, 0.7],
  "output_justification": "This value comes directly from Section 3 of the paper where the authors state \"Through bootstrapping, we get a mean value of z_⊙ = 20.3 ± 0.7 pc\" before accounting for asymmetry. The task replicates the data selection, binning, model fitting, and statistical approach used in the paper.",
