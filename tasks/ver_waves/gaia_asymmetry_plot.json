    "instructions": "Using the same sample of Gaia DR2 main-sequence stars from the `solar_height_from_gaia_dr2` task:\n\nStep 1 - Calculate the number count asymmetry\n* For each color slice, compute the asymmetry parameter:\n  $A(z) = \\frac{n(z) - n(-z)}{n(z) + n(-z)}$\n* Use $z_\\odot = 20.3$ pc to correct observed heights to the Galactic mid-plane reference frame.\n* Bin stars in constant vertical height bins of 25 pc.\n\nStep 2 - Create the visualization\n* Create a figure similar to Figure 4 in the paper.\n* Plot the asymmetry parameter $A(z)$ vs. vertical height $z$ (in kpc) for vertical heights from 0 to 1.5 kpc.\n* Display individual color slices as small dots, color-coded by their $(G_{BP} - G_{RP})$ value.\n* Calculate and plot the median asymmetry (across all color bins) as larger triangular markers.\n* Include appropriate axis labels, legend, and error indicators.\n\nOutput Produce a publication-quality figure in PNG format showing the asymmetry pattern in the Gaia DR2 data.",
