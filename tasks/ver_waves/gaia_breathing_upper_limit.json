  "description": "Calculate an upper bound on the local vertical breathing-mode amplitude $|v_{\\text{breath}}|$ in the Milky Way disk using Gaia DR2 radial-velocity stars.",
  "instructions": "To determine the local vertical breathing-mode amplitude $|v_{\\text{breath}}|$, use Gaia DR2 RVS from gdr2_RV.fits stars within a 250 pc radius cylinder centered on the Sun, applying the general methodology for vertical velocity analysis detailed in Section 5 of the paper. First, transform the measured stellar velocities (proper motions and radial velocities) to Galactocentric Cartesian coordinates, correcting for the Sun's motion by adding its vertical velocity $W_\\odot = +7.25 \\text{ km s}^{-1}$. Next, bin the stars by absolute vertical distance $|z|$ from the mid-plane using symmetric bins. For each bin, compute the mean vertical velocity $W(z)$ and estimate its uncertainty using bootstrap resampling. Then, for each pair of symmetric bins at $\\pm z$, calculate the breathing mode amplitude as $v_{\\text{breath}}(|z|) = 0.5 [ W(z) - W(-z) ]$, also propagating uncertainties. Finally, report the maximum absolute value of $v_{\\text{breath}}(|z|)$ found across all $|z| \\leq 1 \\text{ kpc}$, rounded to one decimal place.",
