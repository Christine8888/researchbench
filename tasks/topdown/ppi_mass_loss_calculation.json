    "instructions": "1. The paper presents a fitting formula for the amount of mass lost due to pulsational-pair instability (PPI) as a function of carbon-oxygen core mass (MCO) and metallicity (Z).\n2. Download the datafile1.txt from Zenodo (record ID 3346593).\n3. The formula is: ΔM_PPI = (0.0006 × log10(Z) + 0.0054) × (MCO - 34.8)³ - 0.0013 × (MCO - 34.8)²\n4. Implement this formula in Python.\n5. Calculate ΔM_PPI for MCO = 50 M☉ and Z = 0.001 (solar masses).\n6. Return the calculated mass loss in solar masses.",
