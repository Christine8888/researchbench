        "**Data/Models Required:**",
        "  - Stellar properties (Mass, Teff, Age) from 'Gaia Catalogue of Nearby Stars (GCNS)' (Smart et al. 2021).",
        "  - Planet occurrence rates/distributions from 'Exoplanet Demographics' (Bergsten et al. 2022).",
        "  - Habitable Zone boundary equations from 'Habitable Zone Parameterization' (Kopparapu et al. 2014).",
        "  - Stellar luminosity evolution from 'Stellar Luminosity Evolution Grid' (Baraffe et al. 1998).",
        "  - NUV flux evolution from 'HZ NUV Flux Evolution Data' (Richey-Yowell et al. 2023 / `past-UV.csv`).",
        "Define FGK dwarf stars: Use criteria like Teff >= 3900 K and Teff < 7500 K.",
        "Generate a representative synthetic population of FGK dwarf stars using properties from GCNS. Assign ages (e.g., sample up to 10 Gyr).",
        "For each FGK dwarf, generate synthetic planets based on Bergsten et al. (2022) demographics.",
        "Filter for potentially rocky, transiting planets: Select planets with radii 0.8*S^0.25 < R/R_earth < 1.4 (S is relative instellation) and transiting geometry.",
        "For each potentially habitable transiting planet:",
        "  a. Implement HZ calculation using Kopparapu et al. (2014) parameterization.",
        "  b. Implement stellar luminosity evolution using Baraffe et al. (1998) models based on host star mass.",
        "  c. Determine time intervals planet was within the evolving HZ.",
        "  d. Implement NUV flux evolution using Richey-Yowell et al. (2023) data (e.g., use 'K' column from `past-UV.csv` based on host star type/age).",
        "  e. Check Condition 1: Is the planet currently within the HZ?",
        "  f. Check Condition 2: Was there any past continuous interval >= Delta_T_min where the planet was *simultaneously* in HZ AND received NUV flux >= F_NUV,min?",
        "Set parameters: F_NUV,min = 250.0 erg/s/cm^2, Delta_T_min = 100 Myr.",
