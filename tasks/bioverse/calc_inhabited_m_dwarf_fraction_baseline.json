      "**Data/Models Required:**",
        "  - Stellar properties (Mass, Teff, Age) from 'Gaia Catalogue of Nearby Stars (GCNS)' (Smart et al. 2021).",
        "  - Planet occurrence rates/distributions from 'Exoplanet Demographics' (Bergsten et al. 2022).",
        "  - Habitable Zone boundary equations from 'Habitable Zone Parameterization' (Kopparapu et al. 2014).",
        "  - Stellar luminosity evolution from 'Stellar Luminosity Evolution Grid' (Baraffe et al. 1998).",
        "  - NUV flux evolution from 'HZ NUV Flux Evolution Data' (Richey-Yowell et al. 2023 / `past-UV.csv`).",
        "Define M dwarf stars: Use criteria like Teff < 3900 K and stellar mass < 0.6 M_sun.",
        "Generate a representative synthetic population of M dwarf stars using properties from GCNS. Assign ages (e.g., sample up to 10 Gyr).",
        "For each M dwarf, generate synthetic planets based on Bergsten et al. (2022) demographics.",
        "Filter for potentially rocky, transiting planets: Select planets with radii 0.8*S^0.25 < R/R_earth < 1.4 (where S is relative instellation) and transiting geometry.",
        "For each potentially habitable transiting planet:",
        "  a. Implement HZ calculation using Kopparapu et al. (2014) parameterization.",
        "  b. Implement stellar luminosity evolution using Baraffe et al. (1998) models based on host star mass.",
        "  c. Determine time intervals planet was within the evolving HZ.",
        "  d. Implement NUV flux evolution using Richey-Yowell et al. (2023) data (e.g., interpolate from `past-UV.csv` based on host star type/age).",
        "  e. Check Condition 1: Is the planet currently within the HZ?",
        "  f. Check Condition 2: Was there any past continuous interval >= Delta_T_min where the planet was *simultaneously* in HZ AND received NUV flux >= F_NUV,min?",
        "Set parameters: F_NUV,min = 300.0 erg/s/cm^2, Delta_T_min = 1 Myr.",
