    "description": "Calculate the RMS residual force error on a homogeneous particle lattice configuration.",
    "instructions": "Set up a simulation with particles placed on a uniform cubic lattice of N=512^3 particles in a periodic box. Configure Abacus with Cells Per Dimension (CPD) set to 125 (co-prime with 512) and multipole order p=8. Calculate the force on each particle using Abacus in single precision. Since the net force should be zero by symmetry, any calculated force is a residual error force $\\vec{F}_{err}$. Convert this force error into an equivalent Lagrangian displacement $\\vec{d}$ using the Zel'dovich Approximation scaling (i.e., relating force to acceleration and then displacement via the growth factor and scale factor, though absolute scaling may cancel). Express this displacement as a fraction of the initial inter-particle spacing $L/N^{1/3}$, where L is the box size. Calculate the root-mean-square (RMS) magnitude of this fractional displacement vector over all particles.",
