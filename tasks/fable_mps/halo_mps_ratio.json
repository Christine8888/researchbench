   "instructions": "For each simulation model (Fiducial, RadioWeak, Quasar, RadioStrong), take the corresponding halo-only MPS and compute the ratio to the halo-only DMO MPS, i.e., P_halo_baryon(k)/P_halo_DMO(k). Save the ratio as a text file with two columns: wavenumber k (in units of h/cMpc) and the MPS ratio (dimensionless).",
