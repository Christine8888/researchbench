 We report the discovery of a two-dimensional Galaxy Manifold within the multi-dimensional luminosity space of local galaxies. The multi-dimensional luminosity space is constructed using 11 bands that span from far ultraviolet to near-infrared for redshift < 0.1 galaxies observed with \textsl{GALEX}, SDSS, and UKIDSS. The two latent parameters are sufficient to express [NUMERICAL_RESULT]\% of the variance in the galaxy sample, suggesting that this Galaxy Manifold is one of the most efficient representations of galaxies. The transformation between the observed luminosities and the manifold parameters as an analytic mapping is provided. The manifold representation provides accurate ([NUMERICAL_RESULT]\%) morphological classifications with a simple linear boundary, and galaxy properties can be estimated with minimal scatter ([NUMERICAL_RESULT] dex and [NUMERICAL_RESULT] dex for star formation rate and stellar mass, respectively) by calibrating with the two-dimensional manifold location. Under the assumption that the manifold expresses the possible parameter space of galaxies, the evolution on the manifold is considered. We find that constant and exponentially decreasing star formation histories form almost orthogonal modes of evolution on the manifold. Through these simple models, we understand that the two modes are closely related to gas content, which suggests the close relationship of the manifold to gas accretion. Without assuming a star formation history, a gas-regulated model reproduces an exponentially declining star formation history with a timescale of $\sim$[NUMERICAL_RESULT] Gyrs on the manifold. Lastly, the found manifold suggests a paradigm where galaxies are characterized by their mass/scale and specific SFR, which agrees with previous studies of dimensionality reduction.

\section{Introduction} \label{sec:introduction}

 A key issue in observational astronomy is understanding how galaxies evolve in their lifetimes. However, galaxy evolution is a complicated interplay of many multiscale processes. Some physical processes that we know of are accretion of gas into the haloes \citep[e.g.,][]{Rubin_2012,Somerville_2015,Zabl_2019}, cooling of gas to form stars \citep[e.g.,][]{Ribau_2011,Saintonage_2011a,Tacconi_2013}, feedback in that interfere with star formation \citep[e.g.,][]{Springel_2005,Fabian_2012,Tombesi_2015,Takeuchi_2022}, and galaxy merging \citep[e.g.,][]{Moster_2011,Hopkins_2013,Fensch_2017}. 
 
 To understand these processes, astronomers can observe galaxies' spectral energy distribution (SEDs), which encodes information about these various processes. Complex physical models can now produce the SEDs that closely mimic observed SEDs \citep[e.g.,][]{Maraston_2011,Conroy_2013,Nishida_2022} and these synthetic SEDs can be used to fit the observations to derive physical properties of galaxies such as star formation rates (SFR), stellar mass ($M_*$), dust attenuation, and star formation history \citep[e.g.,][]{Tojeiro_2007,Leja_2017,Carnall_2018, Robotham_2020}. 
 
 Physical properties derived from observations can give us clues on various aspects of galaxy evolution. Interestingly, many of these properties show clear correlations between them, and many empirical relations called scaling relations have been discussed \citep[e.g.,][]{Faber_1973, Kormendy_1977, Dressler_1987, Roberts_1994, Kennicutt_1998, Wijesinghe_2012}. Many scaling relations have been joined in 3D to form 2D fundamental planes \citep[e.g.,][]{Djorgovski_1987, Jeong_2009, Lara-Lopez_2010, Bezanson_2013, Porter_2014, Kashino_2019}. Such fundamental planes suggest that galaxies lie in an intrinsically low dimensional space within the higher dimensional space, which can also be called a manifold. The manifold where galaxies distribute themselves within the higher dimensional space can be called a "Galaxy Manifold" and has been discussed in the past \citep{Djorgovski_1992}. A continuous galaxy manifold representing the fundamental parameters will greatly facilitate understanding the general properties of galaxy evolution.
 
 Such a galaxy manifold could be found in a data-driven way by using dimensionality reduction, which can also be considered a form of manifold learning in this context. One of the most popular dimensionality reduction techniques is principal component analysis (PCA). For example, \citet{Yip_2004a} used PCA to find components that best approximate linear combinations to the SDSS spectra and found that 50 components are necessary to acceptably represent the data. To combat the issue of having too many components in the latent space with linear methods, non-linear dimensionality reduction techniques have also been used on observations \citep[e.g.,][]{Vanderplas_2009,in_der_Au_2012,Rahmani_2018,Hemmati_2019, Portillo_2020,Davidzon_2022}.

 
 However, a significant drawback of these powerful non-linear techniques is that the transformations between the latent and data space are complicated and cannot be written down analytically. A different solution to the above can be to choose the input features for dimensionality reduction more wisely. Astronomers have traditionally excelled in this process through photometry. Photometric filters are designed to be the most informative of galaxies, as spectroscopy is too expensive. Therefore, looking for the manifold within the multi-dimensional luminosity space is meaningful. 
 
 Galaxies distribute bimodally in the color and magnitude space, where we have the star-forming "blue cloud" and the more quiescent "red sequence" \citep[e.g.,][]{Tully_1982,Strateva_2001,Baldry_2004,Baldry_2006}. The transitional population is considered the "green valley" \citep[e.g.,][]{Bell_2004, Faber_2007, Martin_2007, Schiminovich_2007, Wyder_2007, Mendez_2011, Goncalves_2012}. There have also been works questioning this view, where galaxies are defined on a curve within the multi-dimensional space \citep{Ascasibar_2011}. A manifold representing the galaxy's evolution as a continuous sequence would be advantageous as it would better represent the evolutionary stage and its physical parameters. As a solution, we consider near-ultraviolet (NUV) bands in our analysis as galaxies are known to distribute continuously from "blue cloud" to "red sequence" when represented with NUV-based colors \citep[e.g.,][]{Bundy_2010, Chilingarian_2012, Arnouts_2013, Cibinel_2013, Davidzon_2016, Siudek_2018}.
 
 In this work, we report the discovery of a 2D galaxy manifold within the multi-dimensional luminosity space from far ultraviolet to near-infrared, which can be easily recovered with analytical transformations. The found manifold can be considered the ideal representation of the galaxy distribution in the color space and provides a convenient tool to characterize galaxies. In Sections \ref{sec:data} and \ref{sec:analysis}, we explain the data and the methods used to find this manifold. After that, we discuss the relationship between the found manifold and the galaxy's physical processes in Section \ref{sec:physical_properties}. In Section \ref{sec:evolution}, we consider the scenario where galaxies evolve on the manifold using simple models of galaxy evolution. Section \ref{sec:discussion} includes some discussion on the physical meaning of the manifold axes, drawbacks of the current methods, and some possibilities when using the manifold. We make some conclusions in Section \ref{sec:conclusion}. The paper uses magnitudes expressed in the AB system \citep{Oke_1983} and assumes an universal Chabrier IMF \citep{Chabrier_2003} and Plank 2018 cosmology \citep{Plank_2020}.

\section{Data} \label{sec:data}

 We make use of the Reference Catalog of galaxy Spectral Energy Distributions \citep[RCSED;][]{Chilingarian_2017} for this study. The RCSED catalog is a value-added catalog of $\approximately$800,000 SDSS galaxies, which contains spectra and $K$-corrected photometry. This work employs the integrated photometry available in 11 bands at ultraviolet (UV), optical, and near-infrared (IR) from \textsl{GALEX} (\textit{FUV} and \textit{NUV}), SDSS (\textit{u, g, r, i, z}), and UKIDSS (\textit{Y, J, H, K}), respectively.
