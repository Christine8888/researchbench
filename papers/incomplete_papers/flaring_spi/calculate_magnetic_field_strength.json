    "instructions": "For the stars AU Mic (TIC 441462736) and K2-25 (TIC 72599033), estimate the average surface magnetic field strength (B) and its uncertainty in Gauss. First, calculate the convective turnover time (tau) using the bolometric luminosity (L_bol) and Equation 5. Second, calculate the Rossby number (Ro = P_rot / tau) using the stellar rotation period (P_rot). Use L_bol and P_rot values and their uncertainties from Table 1/3 (combined table Tables_1_3_star_planet_systems.csv). Third, use the calculated Ro to estimate B using the appropriate empirical relation (Equation 3 for Ro > 0.13 or Equation 4 for Ro < 0.13). Propagate uncertainties from L_bol, P_rot, and the empirical relations' coefficients to estimate the uncertainty in B. Return the results as a list of tuples, where each tuple contains (B in G, uncertainty in G).",
