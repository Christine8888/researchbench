    "instructions": "For the star-planet systems TOI-540 (TIC 282326377) and HIP 67522 (TIC 97209190), calculate the relative velocity (v_rel) between the magnetic field of the star (assumed co-rotating with the surface) and the innermost planet at its orbital distance using Equation 2. Use the stellar rotation period (P_rot), orbital period (P_orb), and semi-major axis (a) provided in Table 1/3 (combined table Tables_1_3_star_planet_systems.csv). Propagate the uncertainties given for P_rot, P_orb, and a (using the method described in Sec 2.4 for 'a') to estimate the uncertainty in v_rel. Return the results as a list of tuples, where each tuple contains (v_rel in km/s, uncertainty in km/s).",
