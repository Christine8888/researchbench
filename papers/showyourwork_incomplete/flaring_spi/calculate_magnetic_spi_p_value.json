    "description": "Calculate the p-value for flare clustering in orbital phase (magnetic SPI) for HIP 67522.",
    "instructions": "Perform the custom Anderson-Darling (AD) test described in Section 3.2 and 4.4 for the HIP 67522 system (TIC 97209190). Use the flare times for flares with Equivalent Duration (ED) > 1s identified for this star (from Table 2 or re-identified from light curves). Convert flare peak times to orbital phases using the orbital period and epoch from Table 1/3 (combined table Tables_1_3_star_planet_systems.csv). Calculate the expected cumulative distribution of flare phases, accounting for the phase coverage and base flare rate in each available TESS light curve (Sector 11, 12, 64). Generate 10000 samples from the expected distribution, calculate the AD statistic A^2 for each sample to get a distribution of A^2 values. Calculate A^2 for the observed flare phases. Determine the p-value as the fraction of simulated A^2 values greater than or equal to the observed A^2. Repeat this process for four equidistant start phases (0, 0.25, 0.5, 0.75) as described in Section 3.2. Return the final p-value (mean of the four trials) and its uncertainty (standard deviation of the four trials) as a tuple (p_value, p_value_uncertainty).",

This value represents the significance of flare clustering in phase with the orbital period (P_orb).",
