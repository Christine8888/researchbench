    "instructions": "Using the provided light curve data for HIP 67522 (TIC 97209190) from TESS Sector 11, identify the first two flare events listed in Table 2 of the paper (tstart approximately 1663.8068 and 1665.5918 BJD). For each flare, calculate its equivalent duration (ED) in seconds using Equation 1. This involves integrating the relative flare flux (flare flux / median stellar flux) over the duration of the flare. Use the de-trended flux provided in the dataset. Return the ED values as a list.",
