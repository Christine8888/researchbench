{"completion": "Looking at the paper and the tasks, I need to provide educated guesses for each task based on the methodology described in the Bayesian noise wave calibration paper.\n\nBased on the paper's content and the task descriptions:\n\n1. **evidence**: This asks for evidence values with increasing polynomial orders (0-6). The paper mentions an \"Occam's cliff\" where evidence peaks at the true model order (2) then decreases. Evidence values should be negative log-likelihood type values.\n\n2. **nwp_set**: This asks for sigma values (noise spreads) for 4, 6, and 8 calibrator sets. More calibrators should reduce uncertainty, so values should decrease.\n\n3. **hot_temp**: Retrieving hot load temperature. The paper mentions hot loads are typically heated, so this should be significantly above ambient (~298K).\n\n4. **cold_hot_tandem**: Best-fit values for TL and TNS when using both calibrators. Based on the defined constants, TL should be ~298K (ambient) and TNS should be ~1200K.\n\n5. **cold_temp**: Cold load temperature retrieval. Should be close to ambient temperature (~298K).\n\n6. **load_cal**: Full calibration of 50 Ohm load. The paper states the RMS error was 8 mK with good accuracy, so this should be close to ambient temperature.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"evidence\": [-2847.3, -2654.1, -2398.7, -2456.2, -2523.8, -2598.4, -2681.9],\n  \"nwp_set\": [3.2, 2.1, 1.4],\n  \"hot_temp\": 423.7,\n  \"cold_hot_tandem\": [298.1, 1199.8],\n  \"cold_temp\": 298.2,\n  \"load_cal\": 297.9\n}\n```", "parsed": {"evidence": [-2847.3, -2654.1, -2398.7, -2456.2, -2523.8, -2598.4, -2681.9], "nwp_set": [3.2, 2.1, 1.4], "hot_temp": 423.7, "cold_hot_tandem": [298.1, 1199.8], "cold_temp": 298.2, "load_cal": 297.9}, "score": 0.0, "field_scores": {"cold_temp": 0.0, "nwp_set": 0.0, "cold_hot_tandem": 0.0, "hot_temp": 0.0, "evidence": 0.0, "load_cal": 0.0}, "field_issues": {"cold_temp": ["Value 298.2 exceeds tolerance 0 from expected 298.0"], "nwp_set": ["At index [0]: Value 3.2 exceeds tolerance 0 from expected 1.02", "At index [1]: Value 2.1 exceeds tolerance 0 from expected 1.0", "At index [2]: Value 1.4 exceeds tolerance 0 from expected 0.98"], "cold_hot_tandem": ["At index [0]: Value 298.1 exceeds tolerance 0 from expected 298.0", "At index [1]: Value 1199.8 exceeds tolerance 0 from expected 1200.0"], "hot_temp": ["Value 423.7 exceeds tolerance 0 from expected 373.0"], "evidence": ["At index [0]: Value -2847.3 exceeds tolerance 0 from expected -44000.0", "At index [1]: Value -2654.1 exceeds tolerance 0 from expected -21200.0", "At index [2]: Value -2398.7 exceeds tolerance 0 from expected -21000.0", "At index [3]: Value -2456.2 exceeds tolerance 0 from expected -21000.0", "At index [4]: Value -2523.8 exceeds tolerance 0 from expected -21000.0", "At index [5]: Value -2598.4 exceeds tolerance 0 from expected -21000.0", "At index [6]: Value -2681.9 exceeds tolerance 0 from expected -21000.0"], "load_cal": ["Value 297.9 exceeds tolerance 0 from expected 298.0"]}, "error_msg": ""}
{"completion": "Based on my analysis of the paper manuscript, I'll provide educated guesses for each task:\n\n**Task 1 (evidence)**: This asks for evidence values with increasing polynomial orders 0-6.
