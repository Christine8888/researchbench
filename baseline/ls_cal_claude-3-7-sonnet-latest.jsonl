Based on temperature modeling in section 4.2, I estimate the average corrected temperature would be around 365 K.\n\nFor TASK 2 (cold_sparam), since cold loads typically have very small reflection coefficients (mentioned as \"generally measured to be very small (typically on the order of 0.005 or less)\"), I would expect the average real part to be close to 0.003.\n\nFor TASK 3 (antenna_temp), the paper states in section 5 that they achieved \"an 80 mK RMSE for the model antenna.\" With 15 times more data, this would reduce by a factor of sqrt(15), giving approximately 20.6 mK.\n\nFor TASK 4 (cab_temp), the paper mentions cable-based calibrators having approximately a 3-degree difference between the cable and load. Given the mentioned ambient temperature values around 301-303 K, I estimate the average corrected temperature would be approximately 301.5 K.\n\nFor TASK 5 (nwp), the noise wave parameters would represent the receiver characteristics.
