For Task 1 (median periods and amplitudes): The paper mentions SMC SARGs have shorter periods and lower amplitudes than LMC SARGs due to lower metallicity and younger ages. Table references suggest A-sequence stars have shorter periods than B-sequence stars.\n\n2. For Task 2 (All Stars TRGB): The paper reports various TRGB measurements, and mentions the All Stars sample gives results around 13.9-14.0 mag in I-band.\n\n3. For Task 3 (A and B sequence TRGBs): The paper consistently shows B-sequence yields brighter (lower magnitude) TRGB than A-sequence, with differences of several hundredths of magnitudes.\n\n4. For Task 4 (polynomial fits): The paper provides the actual polynomial coefficients in the text for the W_VI vs log(P1) relations.\n\nBased on the numerical results mentioned in the paper and the patterns described:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"med_color_amp\": [35.2, 0.08, 42.8, 0.12],\n  \"gaia_synthetic_i_trgb\": 13.921,\n  \"aseq_bseq_trgb\": [13.965, 13.920],\n  \"fit_aseq_bseq\": [-0.4234, -0.6789, 13.8456, -0.3891, -0.5234, 13.7823]\n}\n```", "parsed": {"med_color_amp": [35.2, 0.08, 42.8, 0.12], "gaia_synthetic_i_trgb": 13.921, "aseq_bseq_trgb": [13.965, 13.92], "fit_aseq_bseq": [-0.4234, -0.6789, 13.8456, -0.3891, -0.5234, 13.7823]}, "score": 0.0, "field_scores": {"fit_aseq_bseq": 0.0, "gaia_synthetic_i_trgb": 0.0, "med_color_amp": 0.0, "aseq_bseq_trgb": 0.0}, "field_issues": {"fit_aseq_bseq": ["At index [0]: Value -0.4234 exceeds tolerance 0.05 from expected -1.68", "At index [1]: Value -0.6789 exceeds tolerance 0.05 from expected 0.71", "At index [2]: Value 13.8456 exceeds tolerance 0.5 from expected 15.16", "At index [3]: Value -0.3891 exceeds tolerance 0.05 from expected -0.68", "At index [4]: Value -0.5234 exceeds tolerance 0.05 from expected -1.48", "At index [5]: Value 13.7823 exceeds tolerance 0.5 from expected 16.91"], "gaia_synthetic_i_trgb": ["Value 13.921 exceeds tolerance 0.015 from expected 14.969"], "med_color_amp": ["At index [0]: Value 35.2 exceeds tolerance 1.0 from expected 21.0", "At index [1]: Value 0.08 exceeds tolerance 0.0015 from expected 0.009", "At index [2]: Value 42.8 exceeds tolerance 1.0 from expected 36.0", "At index [3]: Value 0.12 exceeds tolerance 0.0015 from expected 0.013"], "aseq_bseq_trgb": ["At index [0]: Value 13.965 exceeds tolerance 0.015 from expected 15.07", "At index [1]: Value 13.92 exceeds tolerance 0.015 from expected 14.933"]}, "error_msg": ""}
