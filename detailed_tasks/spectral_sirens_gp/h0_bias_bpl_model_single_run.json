    "instructions": [
        "1. Load the primary simulated GW event catalog from `gw_data.zip` (the same dataset used for Figure 1 results in the paper).",
        "2. Implement the 'Broken Power Law' model for the BBH primary mass distribution as described in the paper, referencing Abbott et al. 2021b, without applying a high-mass truncation.",
        "3. Set up the Broken Power Law model with parameters: power law slope $\\alpha$, minimum mass $m_{min}$, break mass $m_{break}$, and second power law slope $\\alpha_2$, using appropriate priors.",
        "4. Configure the hierarchical Bayesian inference framework using the population likelihood from Equation 1.",
        "5. Set the true underlying cosmological parameters: $H_{0,true} = 67.66$ km/s/Mpc, $\\Omega_M = 0.3$, $\\Omega_\\Lambda = 0.7$ (flat $\\Lambda$CDM model).",
        "6. Use a uniform prior on $H_0$ (range: 30-120 km/s/Mpc) while keeping other cosmological parameters fixed at their true values.",
        "7. Apply the redshift distribution from Equation A3 with fixed parameters: $z_p = 2.4$, $\\alpha_z = 1.0$, $\\beta_z = 3.4$.",
        "8. Run MCMC sampling using the no-u-turn sampler to obtain the posterior distribution for $H_0$.",
        "9. From the $H_0$ posterior samples, calculate the mean value $\\mu_{H0,inferred}$.",
        "10. Calculate the standard deviation of the $H_0$ posterior: $\\sigma_{H0,inferred}$.",
        "11. Compute the bias metric: $|\\mu_{H0,inferred} - 67.66| / \\sigma_{H0,inferred}$.",
        "12. Report this bias value as the final result."
