    "description": "Calculate the percentage of simulated catalogs (from a set of 50) for which the Power Law + Peak mass model produces an H0 estimate biased by more than 1\u03c3 from the true value.",
    "instructions": [
        "1. Extract and load all 50 separate simulated GW event catalogs from the `bias.zip` file.",
        "2. For each of the 50 catalogs, perform an independent spectral siren analysis using the hierarchical Bayesian framework described in \\ref{sec:methods}.",
        "3. Implement the 'Power Law + Peak' model for the BBH primary mass distribution as described in the paper, referencing Abbott et al. 2021b, without applying a high-mass truncation.",
        "4. Configure the Power Law + Peak model with parameters from Equation A2: power law slope $\\alpha$, minimum mass $m_{min}$, maximum mass $m_{max}$, Gaussian peak location $\\mu$, peak width $\\sigma$, and peak fraction $f_{peak}$.",
        "5. Set the true underlying cosmological parameters for all simulations: $H_{0,true} = 67.66$ km/s/Mpc, $\\Omega_M = 0.3$, $\\Omega_\\Lambda = 0.7$ (flat $\\Lambda$CDM model).",
        "6. For each catalog, use uniform priors on $H_0$ (range: 30-120 km/s/Mpc) while keeping other cosmological parameters fixed at their true values.",
        "7. Apply the redshift distribution from Equation A3 with parameters: $z_p = 2.4$, $\\alpha_z = 1.0$, $\\beta_z = 3.4$.",
        "8. Run MCMC sampling using the no-u-turn sampler to obtain the posterior distribution for $H_0$ for each catalog.",
        "9. For each catalog's $H_0$ posterior, calculate the mean value $\\mu_{H0,inferred}$ and standard deviation $\\sigma_{H0,inferred}$.",
        "10. For each catalog, compute the bias metric: $|\\mu_{H0,inferred} - 67.66| / \\sigma_{H0,inferred}$.",
        "11. Determine if each catalog is biased by more than $1\\sigma$ by checking if the condition $|\\mu_{H0,inferred} - 67.66| / \\sigma_{H0,inferred} > 1$ is satisfied.",
        "12. Count the total number of catalogs ($N_{biased}$) out of 50 that meet this bias condition.",
        "13. Calculate the percentage of biased catalogs: $(N_{biased} / 50) \\times 100$.",
        "14. Report this percentage as the final result."
