    "instructions": [
        "1. Extract and load all 50 separate simulated GW event catalogs from the `bias.zip` file.",
        "2. For each of the 50 catalogs, perform an independent spectral siren analysis using the hierarchical Bayesian framework described in \\ref{sec:methods}.",
        "3. Implement the 'Broken Power Law' model for the BBH primary mass distribution as described in the paper, referencing Abbott et al. 2021b, without applying a high-mass truncation.",
        "4. Set the Broken Power Law model parameters with appropriate priors: power law slope $\\alpha$, minimum mass $m_{min}$, break mass $m_{break}$, and second power law slope $\\alpha_2$.",
        "5. Fix the true underlying cosmological parameters for all simulations: $H_{0,true} = 67.66$ km/s/Mpc, $\\Omega_M = 0.3$, $\\Omega_\\Lambda = 0.7$ (flat $\\Lambda$CDM model).",
        "6. For each catalog, use uniform priors on $H_0$ (range: 30-120 km/s/Mpc) while keeping other cosmological parameters fixed at their true values.",
        "7. Run the MCMC sampling using the no-u-turn sampler to obtain the posterior distribution for $H_0$ for each catalog.",
        "8. For each catalog's $H_0$ posterior, calculate the mean value $\\mu_{H0,inferred}$ and standard deviation $\\sigma_{H0,inferred}$.",
        "9. For each catalog, compute the bias metric: $|\\mu_{H0,inferred} - 67.66| / \\sigma_{H0,inferred}$.",
        "10. Determine if each catalog is biased by more than $1\\sigma$ by checking if the condition $|\\mu_{H0,inferred} - 67.66| / \\sigma_{H0,inferred} > 1$ is satisfied.",
        "11. Count the total number of catalogs ($N_{biased}$) out of 50 that meet this bias condition.",
        "12. Calculate the percentage of biased catalogs: $(N_{biased} / 50) \\times 100$.",
        "13. Report this percentage as the final result."
