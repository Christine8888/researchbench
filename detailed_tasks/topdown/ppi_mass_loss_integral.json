    "description": "Calculate the average pulsational-pair instability mass loss across a distribution of carbon-oxygen core masses at a fixed metallicity.",
    "instructions": [
        "1. Use the PPI mass loss formula fitted in the previous analysis, implementing the function $\\Delta M_{PPI}(M_{CO}, Z)$ from \\ref{eq:fit}.",
        "2. Set the metallicity value to $Z = 0.001$ (the same value used in the previous calculation) for consistency in the analysis.",
        "3. Define the integration limits for the carbon-oxygen core mass range: $M_{CO,min} = 40\\\\,M_\\odot$ and $M_{CO,max} = 50\\\\,M_\\odot$.",
        "4. Set up the integral to compute the average $\\Delta M_{PPI}$ over the specified range: $\\langle\\Delta M_{PPI}\\rangle = \\frac{1}{M_{CO,max} - M_{CO,min}} \\int_{M_{CO,min}}^{M_{CO,max}} \\Delta M_{PPI}(M_{CO}, Z) \\\\, dM_{CO}$.",
        "5. Choose an appropriate numerical integration method (e.g., scipy.integrate.quad) to evaluate the integral, given that the PPI formula contains polynomial terms.",
        "6. Implement the integration by defining an integrand function that evaluates $\\Delta M_{PPI}(M_{CO}, 0.001)$ for a given $M_{CO}$ value.",
        "7. Perform the numerical integration over the range $[40, 50]$ solar masses, ensuring adequate precision for the integration routine.",
        "8. Divide the integral result by the interval width (10 solar masses) to obtain the average value.",
        "9. Validate the result by checking that it falls within reasonable bounds based on the individual $\\Delta M_{PPI}$ values at the endpoints of the integration range.",
        "10. Return the calculated average $\\Delta M_{PPI}$ in solar masses, providing the result with appropriate precision."

    "output_justification": "This value can be estimated by visually integrating the mass loss curve in Figure 1 for Z = 0.001 from MCO = 40 to MCO = 50. The mass loss ranges from approximately 0.4 M\u2609 at MCO = 40 to approximately 11.5 M\u2609 at MCO = 50, with a curve that suggests an average of around 4.75 M\u2609."
