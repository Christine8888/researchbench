    "instructions": [
        "1. Download the datafile1.txt from Zenodo (record ID 3346593) containing the PPI simulation data from Farmer et al. 2019 as referenced in the paper.",
        "2. Parse the data file to extract carbon-oxygen core masses ($M_{CO}$), metallicities ($Z$), and pulsational-pair instability mass loss values ($\\Delta M_{PPI}$).",
        "3. Filter the dataset to include only data points where $38 \\leq M_{CO} \\leq 60$ solar masses, following the methodology described in the paper.",
        "4. Define the PPI mass loss fitting function from \\ref{eq:fit}: $\\Delta M_{PPI} = (a \\times \\log_{10}(Z) + b) \\times (M_{CO} + c)^3 + d \\times (M_{CO} + c)^2$.",
        "5. Use scipy.optimize.curve_fit to fit this function to the filtered data, obtaining the optimal parameters $a$, $b$, $c$, and $d$.",
        "6. Implement the fitted formula as a Python function that takes $M_{CO}$ (in solar masses) and $Z$ (metallicity) as inputs and returns $\\Delta M_{PPI}$ in solar masses.",
        "7. Validate the implementation by checking that the function produces reasonable values within the fitted range ($38 \\leq M_{CO} \\leq 60$).",
        "8. Calculate $\\Delta M_{PPI}$ for the specific case where $M_{CO} = 50\\\\,M_\\odot$ and $Z = 0.001$ using the fitted formula.",
        "9. Handle potential numerical issues by ensuring that $\\log_{10}(Z)$ is computed safely for the given metallicity value.",
        "10. Return the calculated mass loss value in solar masses, rounded to an appropriate number of significant figures based on the fitting accuracy."
