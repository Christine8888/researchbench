    "instructions": [
        "1. Download the datafile1.txt from Zenodo (record ID 3346593) which contains data on carbon-oxygen core masses ($M_{CO}$), metallicities ($Z$), and pulsational-pair instability mass loss ($\\Delta M_{pulse}$) as referenced in \\ref{sec:methods}.",
        "2. Parse the downloaded file to extract the three columns of data: carbon-oxygen core masses, metallicities, and mass loss values. The file contains a header with column names that should be used to identify the correct columns.",
        "3. Filter the dataset to include only data points where $38 \\leq M_{CO} \\leq 60$ solar masses, as specified in the paper's methodology for fitting the PPI mass loss formula.",
        "4. Define the fitting function as presented in \\ref{eq:fit}: $f(M_{CO}, Z) = (a \\times \\log_{10}(Z) + b) \\times (M_{CO} + c)^3 + d \\times (M_{CO} + c)^2$, where $a$, $b$, $c$, and $d$ are the parameters to be fitted.",
        "5. Prepare the data for fitting by creating arrays of independent variables ($M_{CO}$ and $Z$ values) and dependent variable ($\\Delta M_{PPI}$ values) from the filtered dataset.",
        "6. Use scipy.optimize.curve_fit to perform non-linear least squares fitting of the defined function to the filtered data, obtaining optimal values for parameters $a$, $b$, $c$, and $d$.",
        "7. Return the fitted parameter values as a list in the order [$a$, $b$, $c$, $d$], where these parameters correspond to the coefficients in the PPI mass loss formula from \\ref{eq:fit}."
