    "description": "Verify that the fitted formula correctly predicts zero mass loss at the edge of the PPI regime.",
    "instructions": [
        "1. Implement the PPI mass loss formula from \\ref{eq:fit}: $\\Delta M_{PPI} = (a \\times \\log_{10}(Z) + b) \\times (M_{CO} + c)^3 + d \\times (M_{CO} + c)^2$, using the fitted parameters obtained from the Farmer et al. 2019 data.",
        "2. Set the carbon-oxygen core mass to $M_{CO} = 35\\\\,M_\\odot$, which corresponds to the approximate beginning of the PPI regime as stated in the paper.",
        "3. Set the metallicity to $Z = 0.001$ to maintain consistency with previous calculations and to represent a typical low-metallicity scenario.",
        "4. Verify that the implementation correctly handles the logarithmic term $\\log_{10}(Z)$ for the given metallicity value without numerical issues.",
        "5. Calculate the offset term $(M_{CO} + c) = (35 + c)$ where $c$ is the fitted parameter from the PPI formula.",
        "6. Evaluate the cubic term: $(a \\times \\log_{10}(Z) + b) \\times (M_{CO} + c)^3$ using the fitted parameters and the specified values.",
        "7. Evaluate the quadratic term: $d \\times (M_{CO} + c)^2$ using the fitted parameter $d$ and the calculated offset.",
        "8. Combine both terms to obtain the total PPI mass loss: $\\Delta M_{PPI} = \\text{cubic term} + \\text{quadratic term}$.",
        "9. Verify that the result is close to zero (but not exactly zero) as expected at the edge of the PPI regime, confirming the smooth transition mentioned in the paper.",
        "10. Return the calculated $\\Delta M_{PPI}$ value in solar masses, noting that this demonstrates the continuity of the top-down approach at the PPI regime boundary."

    "output_justification": "The paper explicitly states that their approach imposes \u0394MPPI = 0 at the edge of the PPI regime (MCO \u2248 35 M\u2609), and their formula is designed to ensure this. The value of \u0394MPPI for MCO = 35 M\u2609 should therefore be effectively zero."
