    "description": "Quantify the preference for the Weakened Magnetic Braking (WMB) model over the standard spin-down model using chi-squared comparison against LAMOST-McQuillan data.",
    "instructions": [
        "1. Load the LAMOST-McQuillan cross-matched data from the file `lamostmcq` (derived from `kepler_lamost.parquet` and `mcquillan2014_table1.parquet`).",
        "2. Select stars with $\\log g > 4.1$ to focus on main-sequence stars.",
        "3. Calculate the observed 90th percentile $P_{rot}$ curve as a function of $T_{eff}$ using the bootstrapping method: perform 100 resamples, withholding 50% of the data each time.",
        "4. Use $T_{eff}$ bins centered every 20 K between 4000 K and 7000 K with half-widths of 100 K for the percentile calculation.",
        "5. Exclude stars with calculated Rossby number $Ro > 5/3$ during the percentile calculation, where $Ro = P_{rot}/\\tau_{cz}(T_{eff})$ using Equations \\ref{eq:1} and \\ref{eq:2}.",
        "6. Compute the final observed 90th percentile curve as the mean of the bootstrapped percentile values.",
        "7. Load the two model populations from 'standard_population.h5' and 'rocrit_population.h5' files.",
        "8. For each model population, select only main-sequence stars using the evolutionary state flag: $evo = 1$.",
        "9. Calculate the 90th percentile $P_{rot}$ curve as a function of $T_{eff}$ for each model population using the same binning scheme as the observed data.",
        "10. Compare the observed 90th percentile curve to the model curves over the $T_{eff}$ range 5300 K to 6000 K.",
        "11. Calculate the chi-squared statistic for the standard model fit: $\\chi^2_{std} = \\sum \\frac{(P_{obs} - P_{std})^2}{\\sigma^2}$, where $\\sigma$ is derived from bootstrap variance or set to 1 day if variance is too small.",
        "12. Calculate the chi-squared statistic for the WMB model fit: $\\chi^2_{wmb} = \\sum \\frac{(P_{obs} - P_{wmb})^2}{\\sigma^2}$.",
        "13. Compute the difference: $\\Delta\\chi^2 = \\chi^2_{std} - \\chi^2_{wmb}$.",
        "14. Report the value of $\\Delta\\chi^2$ as a single numerical result."
