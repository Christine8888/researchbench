    "description": "Determine the age range encompassing 90% of the CKS stars located on the long-period pileup, using CKS catalog ages.",
    "instructions": [
        "1. Load the CKS data from the file `cks_merged.parquet`, ensuring it includes isochrone ages derived using the CKS pipeline ('CKS ages').",
        "2. Select stars identified as being on the long-period pileup using the criteria described in \\ref{sec:analysis}: $P_{rot}$ is between $(-0.0314 \\times T_{eff} + 199.286)$ and $(-0.0314 \\times T_{eff} + 206.286)$ days.",
        "3. Use 'CKS Teff' values for the temperature-based selection criteria.",
        "4. Apply additional cuts: $\\log g > 4.0$ and $5850$ K $< T_{eff} < 6500$ K to focus on main-sequence stars in the appropriate temperature range.",
        "5. Extract the isochrone ages (in Gyr) for the selected stars from the CKS catalog source.",
        "6. Verify that the age data is available and properly formatted for the selected stars.",
        "7. Calculate the 5th percentile of the ages using appropriate statistical methods (e.g., numpy.percentile).",
        "8. Calculate the 95th percentile of the ages using the same statistical approach.",
        "9. Verify that the calculated percentiles are reasonable (5th percentile < 95th percentile) and within expected stellar age ranges.",
        "10. Report the age range as a list in the format: [5th_percentile_age, 95th_percentile_age] where both values are in Gyr."
