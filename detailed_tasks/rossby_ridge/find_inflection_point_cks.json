    "instructions": [
        "1. Load the CKS data from the file `cks_merged.parquet`.",
        "2. Select stars identified as being on the long-period pileup using the criteria described in \\ref{sec:analysis}: $P_{rot}$ is between $(-0.0314 \\times T_{eff} + 199.286)$ and $(-0.0314 \\times T_{eff} + 206.286)$ days.",
        "3. Apply additional cuts: $\\log g > 4.0$ and $5850$ K $< T_{eff} < 6500$ K.",
        "4. Use $T_{eff}$ values from the CKS catalog ('CKS Teff' source) for all selections and fitting procedures.",
        "5. Perform a piecewise linear fit to the $P_{rot}$ vs $T_{eff}$ relationship for the selected stars, allowing for a break point (inflection point) in $T_{eff}$.",
        "6. Set up MCMC sampling using the \\texttt{emcee} package to estimate the parameters of the piecewise linear fit, including the break point temperature.",
        "7. Configure the MCMC with appropriate priors for the break point temperature, slope parameters before and after the break, and any intercept terms.",
        "8. Run the MCMC sampling for sufficient steps to ensure convergence (assess using autocorrelation lengths).",
        "9. Extract the posterior samples for the inflection point temperature parameter from the MCMC chain.",
        "10. Calculate the median posterior value and uncertainty (e.g., 16th and 84th percentiles) for the inflection point temperature in Kelvin.",
        "11. Report the results as a list: [median_temperature, lower_uncertainty, upper_uncertainty] where uncertainties represent the 1-sigma confidence interval."
