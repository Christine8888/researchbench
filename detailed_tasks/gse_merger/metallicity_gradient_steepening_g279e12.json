    "description": "Calculate the magnitude of the steepening (change in slope) of the cold gas [Fe/H] metallicity gradient for galaxy g2.79e12 during its early major merger phase.",
    "instructions": [
        "1. Load the simulation snapshot data for galaxy g2.79e12 using the appropriate data loading functions.",
        "2. Identify cold gas particles with temperature $T < 15000$ K belonging to the main disk of the galaxy by applying temperature filtering and selecting rotationally-supported disk gas using criteria such as $v_{\\phi} > 0.5 \\times v_{\\rm{circ}}(R)$ and $|z| < 2$ kpc.",
        "3. Load simulation snapshots at two specific time points: $t_1 \\approx 2.0$ Gyr (just before major merger activity) and $t_2 \\approx 3.0$ Gyr (near maximum gradient steepening during merger).",
        "4. For each time point, calculate the cylindrical coordinates $(R, \\phi, z)$ for all cold disk gas particles.",
        "5. Create radial bins covering the range $2.5$ kpc $\\leq R \\leq 17.5$ kpc with bin width $\\Delta R = 1.0$ kpc.",
        "6. For each radial bin, calculate the [Fe/H] metallicity for all gas particles using $[\\rm{Fe/H}] = \\log_{10}(n_{\\rm{Fe}}/n_{\\rm{H}}) - \\log_{10}(n_{\\rm{Fe}}/n_{\\rm{H}})_{\\odot}$.",
        "7. Compute the median [Fe/H] value in each radial bin to create the radial metallicity profile $[\\rm{Fe/H}](R)$.",
        "8. Apply a linear least-squares fit to the metallicity profile: $[\\rm{Fe/H}](R) = a \\times R + b$, where $a$ is the metallicity gradient in dex/kpc.",
        "9. Extract the gradient (slope) $a_1$ for $t_1$ and $a_2$ for $t_2$ from the linear fits.",
        "10. Calculate the gradient difference: $\\Delta a = a_2 - a_1$, representing the change in metallicity gradient between the two time points.",
        "11. Verify that the time points correspond to the merger events shown in \\ref{fig:merger_ratio} and the gradient evolution in \\ref{fig:half_mass}.",
        "12. Report the gradient difference $\\Delta a$ in dex/kpc along with the individual gradient values $a_1$ and $a_2$ for verification."
