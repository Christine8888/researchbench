    "description": "Calculate the maximum percentage increase in the cold gas surface density in the outskirts (R > 8 kpc) of galaxy g2.79e12 due to its major early merger phase.",
    "instructions": [
        "1. Load the simulation snapshot data for galaxy g2.79e12 using the appropriate data loading functions.",
        "2. Identify cold gas particles with temperature $T < 15000$ K belonging to the main galaxy by selecting particles within the virial radius and applying temperature filtering.",
        "3. Load simulation snapshots at two specific time points: $t_{\\rm{before}} \\approx 2.0$ Gyr (just before major merger activity) and $t_{\\rm{after}} \\approx 4.0$ Gyr (after merger gas incorporation but before significant consumption).",
        "4. For each time point, calculate the cylindrical coordinates $(R, \\phi, z)$ for all cold gas particles, where $R$ is the galactocentric radius in the disk plane.",
        "5. Create radial bins from $R = 0$ to $R = 20$ kpc with bin width $\\Delta R = 1$ kpc.",
        "6. For each radial bin, calculate the azimuthally averaged cold gas surface density using $\\Sigma_{\\rm{gas}}(R) = \\sum_{i} m_{\\rm{gas},i} / (2\\pi R \\Delta R)$, where the sum is over all cold gas particles in the radial bin.",
        "7. Apply a smoothing kernel or averaging over adjacent bins to reduce noise in the surface density profile.",
        "8. Extract the average cold gas surface density in the outer disk region $R > 8$ kpc by computing the mean surface density over radial bins with $R > 8$ kpc for both time points.",
        "9. Calculate the percentage increase in outer disk surface density: $\\Delta\\Sigma_{\\\\%} = 100 \\times (\\Sigma_{\\rm{after}} - \\Sigma_{\\rm{before}}) / \\Sigma_{\\rm{before}}$.",
        "10. Verify the calculation by checking that the merger events from \\ref{fig:merger_ratio} occur between the selected time points.",
        "11. Report the maximum percentage increase value found in the outskirts ($R > 8$ kpc) along with the specific radial range where this maximum occurs."
