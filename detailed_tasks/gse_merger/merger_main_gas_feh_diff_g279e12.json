    "description": "Calculate the difference in peak [Fe/H] between a merging satellite's gas and the main galaxy's gas disk for one of the g2.79e12 mergers occurring at t=2.57 Gyr.",
    "instructions": [
        "1. Load the simulation snapshot data for galaxy g2.79e12 at cosmic time $t=2.57$ Gyr using the appropriate data loading functions (e.g., pynbody.load()).",
        "2. Identify the main galaxy progenitor by selecting the most massive halo at this time using halo finder data or by identifying particles within the virial radius of the central galaxy.",
        "3. Identify merging satellites at this time by examining the merger tree data or by finding secondary halos with significant gas mass ratios ($M_{\\rm{gas}}^{\\rm{merger}}/M_{\\rm{gas}}^{\\rm{main}}(t_{\\rm{merger}}) \\gtrsim 10\\\\%$) that are approaching coalescence.",
        "4. Select cold gas particles with temperature $T < 15000$ K from both the main galaxy and the identified satellite using temperature filtering.",
        "5. For the main galaxy, further filter cold gas particles to select only those associated with the rotationally-supported disk by applying criteria such as: (a) radial distance within a few scale lengths of the disk, (b) rotational velocity $v_{\\phi} > 0.5 \\times v_{\\rm{circ}}(R)$, and (c) vertical height $|z| < 2$ kpc.",
        "6. For the satellite, select cold gas particles using halo membership from the halo finder association or by applying a spatial cut around the satellite's center.",
        "7. Calculate the [Fe/H] metallicity for each gas particle using the formula $[\\rm{Fe/H}] = \\log_{10}(n_{\\rm{Fe}}/n_{\\rm{H}}) - \\log_{10}(n_{\\rm{Fe}}/n_{\\rm{H}})_{\\odot}$, where solar values follow standard abundance ratios.",
        "8. Construct metallicity distribution functions (MDFs) for both gas populations by creating histograms of [Fe/H] values with bin width of 0.1 dex covering the range $-3.0 \\leq [\\rm{Fe/H}] \\leq 0.5$.",
        "9. Identify the main peak of each MDF by finding the bin with maximum frequency. For the main galaxy disk gas, select the higher-metallicity peak if multiple peaks exist (typically $[\\rm{Fe/H}] > -1$).",
        "10. Extract the [Fe/H] value corresponding to the center of the peak bin for both populations.",
        "11. Calculate the metallicity difference: $\\Delta[\\rm{Fe/H}] = [\\rm{Fe/H}]_{\\rm{peak,main}} - [\\rm{Fe/H}]_{\\rm{peak,satellite}}$.",
        "12. Report this difference value along with the individual peak metallicity values for verification."
