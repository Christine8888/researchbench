    "description": "Calculate the median [Fe/H] offset between stars associated with the late merger (merging ~9.3 Gyr) in galaxy g2.79e12 and the main galaxy stars of similar age.",
    "instructions": [
        "1. Load the z=0 simulation snapshot for galaxy g2.79e12 using the appropriate data loading functions.",
        "2. Load the merger tree data or particle tracking information to identify stellar particle origins and formation histories.",
        "3. Identify the late merger event that occurred at cosmic time $t_{\\rm{merger}} = 9.3$ Gyr by examining the merger tree or mass accretion history.",
        "4. Classify all stellar particles into two populations based on their origin: (a) Main progenitor stars: formed in the main galaxy before $t_{\\rm{merger}} = 9.3$ Gyr, (b) Satellite stars: originated in the satellite galaxy that merged at $t_{\\rm{merger}} = 9.3$ Gyr.",
        "5. Use particle tracking data, unique particle IDs, or halo membership information to distinguish between these populations. If direct tracking is unavailable, apply chemodynamical selection criteria based on distinct abundance patterns described in \\ref{sec:results-age}.",
        "6. Calculate stellar ages at z=0 using formation times: $\\rm{Age} = t_{\\rm{universe}}(z=0) - t_{\\rm{formation}}$, where $t_{\\rm{universe}}(z=0) \\approx 13.8$ Gyr.",
        "7. Select stars from both populations within the age range corresponding to formation shortly before the merger significantly impacted the main galaxy: $8.8$ Gyr $\\leq t_{\\rm{formation}} \\leq 9.8$ Gyr (corresponding to ages $\\approx 9.5-10.5$ Gyr at z=0).",
        "8. Calculate [Fe/H] metallicity for all selected stars using $[\\rm{Fe/H}] = \\log_{10}(n_{\\rm{Fe}}/n_{\\rm{H}}) - \\log_{10}(n_{\\rm{Fe}}/n_{\\rm{H}})_{\\odot}$.",
        "9. Compute the median [Fe/H] for the main galaxy population: $\\rm{median}([\\rm{Fe/H}]_{\\rm{main}})$.",
        "10. Compute the median [Fe/H] for the satellite population: $\\rm{median}([\\rm{Fe/H}]_{\\rm{merger}})$.",
        "11. Calculate the metallicity difference: $\\Delta[\\rm{Fe/H}] = \\rm{median}([\\rm{Fe/H}]_{\\rm{main}}) - \\rm{median}([\\rm{Fe/H}]_{\\rm{merger}})$.",
        "12. Verify the populations are correctly identified by checking that they follow the distinct tracks described in \\ref{fig:age_feh} and \\ref{fig:ofe_feh}.",
        "13. Report the metallicity difference $\\Delta[\\rm{Fe/H}]$ along with the individual median values and sample sizes for verification."
