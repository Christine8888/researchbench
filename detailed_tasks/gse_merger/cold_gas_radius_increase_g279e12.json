    "instructions": [
        "1. Load the simulation snapshot data for galaxy g2.79e12 using the appropriate data loading functions.",
        "2. Identify cold gas particles with temperature $T < 15000$ K belonging to the main galaxy progenitor by selecting particles within the virial radius and applying temperature filtering.",
        "3. Load simulation snapshots at two specific time points: $t_{\\rm{before}} \\approx 2.0$ Gyr (just before major merger activity begins) and $t_{\\rm{peak}} \\approx 3.0-4.0$ Gyr (near maximum disk extent during merger phase).",
        "4. For each time point, calculate the 3D positions of all cold gas particles relative to the galaxy center.",
        "5. Calculate the distance of each cold gas particle from the galaxy center: $r_i = \\sqrt{x_i^2 + y_i^2 + z_i^2}$.",
        "6. Sort all cold gas particles by their distance from the galaxy center in ascending order.",
        "7. Calculate the cumulative mass distribution: $M_{\\rm{cum}}(r) = \\sum_{r_j \\leq r} m_{\\rm{gas},j}$, where the sum includes all particles within radius $r$.",
        "8. Determine the total cold gas mass: $M_{\\rm{total}} = \\sum_{\\rm{all}} m_{\\rm{gas},i}$.",
        "9. Find the half-mass radius $R_{\\rm{half}}$ by identifying the radius where $M_{\\rm{cum}}(R_{\\rm{half}}) = 0.5 \\times M_{\\rm{total}}$ using interpolation if necessary.",
        "10. Repeat steps 4-9 for both time points to obtain $R_{\\rm{half}}(t_{\\rm{before}})$ and $R_{\\rm{half}}(t_{\\rm{peak}})$.",
        "11. Calculate the ratio of half-mass radii: $\\mathcal{R} = R_{\\rm{half}}(t_{\\rm{peak}}) / R_{\\rm{half}}(t_{\\rm{before}})$.",
        "12. Verify that $t_{\\rm{peak}}$ corresponds to the maximum half-mass radius during the merger phase by checking additional snapshots if available.",
        "13. Report the calculated ratio $\\mathcal{R}$ along with the individual half-mass radius values for verification."
