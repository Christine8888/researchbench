    "instructions": [
        "1. Load the posterior samples from the B-Spline population analysis using the IID component spins model, corresponding to the main results presented in \\ref{sec:results}.",
        "2. Extract the primary mass ($m_1$) samples from each posterior draw in the population analysis.",
        "3. Construct the population predictive distribution (PPD) for primary mass using the B-spline model with knots linearly spaced in $\\log(m_1)$ as described in \\ref{sec:methods}.",
        "4. Apply the minimum black hole mass constraint of $5 M_{\\odot}$ and search within the range $5 M_{\\odot} < m_1 < 100 M_{\\odot}$ as specified in the model setup.",
        "5. Compute the merger rate density as a function of primary mass by evaluating the PPD across the mass range with sufficient resolution to identify local maxima.",
        "6. Use peak-finding algorithms to identify the three distinct local maxima in the merger rate density, expected to occur around $10 M_{\\odot}$, $18 M_{\\odot}$, and $35 M_{\\odot}$ based on previous analyses referenced in \\ref{sec:mass_dist}.",
        "7. For each hyperparameter posterior sample, compute the locations of the three peaks to obtain distributions of peak positions.",
        "8. Calculate the median and 90% credible interval (5th and 95th percentiles) for the location of each peak across all hyperparameter samples.",
        "9. Verify that the identified peaks correspond to the expected features by checking their approximate locations against literature values.",
        "10. Format the output as a dictionary where keys are 'peak1', 'peak2', 'peak3' (corresponding to the peaks around $10 M_{\\odot}$, $18 M_{\\odot}$, and $35 M_{\\odot}$ respectively) and values are lists of [median, upper_bound, lower_bound] in units of $M_{\\odot}$."
