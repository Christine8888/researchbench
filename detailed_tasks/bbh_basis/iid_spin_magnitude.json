    "instructions": [
        "1. Load the posterior samples from the B-Spline population analysis assuming identical and independently distributed (IID) component spins from the dataset referenced in \\ref{sec:methods}.",
        "2. Extract the component spin magnitude parameters ($a_1$, $a_2$) from each posterior sample, where spin magnitudes are dimensionless quantities ranging from 0 to 1.",
        "3. Combine the spin magnitude samples from both components to construct the population predictive distribution (PPD) for spin magnitude $p(a)$, treating both components as draws from the same IID distribution.",
        "4. Apply the B-spline model with 16 knots spaced linearly from 0 to 1 to create a smooth probability density function $p(a)$ as described in \\ref{sec:spin_dist}.",
        "5. Find the location of the peak ($a_{\\mathrm{peak}}$) by identifying the maximum of the PPD using numerical optimization or peak-finding algorithms.",
        "6. Calculate the 90th percentile of the PPD to find the spin magnitude ($a_{90\\\\%}$) below which 90% of the BBH spins lie by solving: $\\int_0^{a_{90\\\\%}} p(a) da = 0.9$.",
        "7. For each hyperparameter posterior sample, compute the corresponding $a_{\\mathrm{peak}}$ and $a_{90\\\\%}$ values to obtain distributions of these quantities.",
        "8. Calculate the median and 90% credible interval (5th and 95th percentiles) for both $a_{\\mathrm{peak}}$ and $a_{90\\\\%}$ across all hyperparameter samples.",
        "9. Verify that the results are consistent with the expected range of spin magnitudes (0 to 1) and check for any unphysical values.",
        "10. Format the output as a dictionary with keys 'a_peak' and 'a_90', where values are lists of [median, upper_bound, lower_bound] representing the computed statistics."
