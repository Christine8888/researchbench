    "instructions": [
        "1. Extract the final orbital parameters for the V773 Tau AB system from \\ref{tab:orbs} 'this work' column.",
        "2. Set the orbital elements: Period = 26.50 \u00b1 0.07 yr, $T_0$ = 2010.11 \u00b1 0.12 yr, $e$ = 0.104 \u00b1 0.009, $\\omega_A$ = 266.0 \u00b1 1.5 deg, $\\Omega$ = 290.54 \u00b1 0.40 deg, $i$ = 69.25 \u00b1 0.40 deg, $a$ = 117.7 \u00b1 0.86 mas.",
        "3. Note that the 2010 eclipse occurred near the epoch of periastron passage as mentioned in \\ref{sec:model}.",
        "4. Convert the argument of periastron $\\omega_A$ from the radial velocity sense to the astrometric sense by adding 180\u00b0 if necessary for proper orbital calculations.",
        "5. Implement Keplerian orbital mechanics to calculate the orbital positions as a function of time.",
        "6. Use the relationship for eccentric anomaly: $M = E - e \\sin E$ where $M$ is the mean anomaly and $E$ is the eccentric anomaly.",
        "7. Calculate the mean anomaly as a function of time: $M(t) = 2\\pi(t - T_0)/P$ where $t$ is time, $T_0$ is the epoch of periastron, and $P$ is the orbital period.",
        "8. Solve Kepler's equation iteratively to find the eccentric anomaly $E$ for future times.",
        "9. Calculate the true anomaly $\\nu$ using: $\\tan(\\nu/2) = \\sqrt{(1+e)/(1-e)} \\tan(E/2)$.",
        "10. Determine the orbital radius: $r = a(1 - e \\cos E)$ where $a$ is the semi-major axis.",
        "11. Calculate the projected positions on the sky using the inclination $i$ and position angle of ascending node $\\Omega$.",
        "12. Identify when the B component passes in front of the A component by finding when the projected separation is minimized and B is in the foreground.",
        "13. Search for the next conjunction event after 2010 by incrementing time and monitoring the relative positions.",
        "14. Determine the exact time when the midpoint of the next eclipse occurs, corresponding to minimum projected separation with B in front of A.",
        "15. Account for the orbital uncertainties by propagating the errors in the orbital elements through the calculation using Monte Carlo sampling.",
        "16. Calculate the uncertainty in the predicted eclipse time by sampling from the orbital parameter distributions and computing the spread in predicted eclipse times.",
        "17. Convert the predicted eclipse time from MJD or decimal years to calendar year format.",
        "18. Return the predicted year of the next eclipse midpoint and its uncertainty as a list of two values: [predicted_year, uncertainty_in_years]."
