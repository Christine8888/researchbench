    "description": "Determine the orbital inclination of the C component around the AB barycenter.",
    "instructions": [
        "1. Load the historical AC astrometry data from Duch\u00eane et al. (2003) and Boden et al. (2012) as referenced in \\ref{sec:orbitalfit}. Extract the epoch, position angle, separation, and associated uncertainties for each measurement.",
        "2. Load the new AC astrometry from this paper's observations (Table \\ref{tab:newastrom}). Use the 'Orbitize!' values: position angle $\\theta(AC) = 139.92 \\pm 0.04$ degrees and separation $\\rho(AC) = 262.05 \\pm 0.28$ mas at epoch MJD 59515.",
        "3. Set the system parameters: masses $M_A = 2.91 M_\\odot$ and $M_B = 2.35 M_\\odot$ from \\ref{tab:physparams}, and system distance $d = 132.8$ pc from \\ref{tab:physparams}.",
        "4. For each epoch of AC astrometry, calculate the position of C relative to the AB barycenter using the formula: $\\vec{r}_{C,bary} = \\vec{r}_{AC} - \\frac{M_B}{M_A + M_B} \\vec{r}_{AB}$, where $\\vec{r}_{AB}$ is determined from the AB orbital solution in \\ref{tab:orbs}.",
        "5. Convert the AC relative positions to C-AB barycenter positions by applying the mass-weighted correction. Use the AB orbital elements from \\ref{tab:orbs} to compute the AB position at each epoch of C observation.",
        "6. Initialize the orbitize! fitting framework with the following parameters: 1000 walkers, 20 temperatures for parallel tempering, 2000 burn-in steps per walker, and 1,000,000 total steps as described in \\ref{sec:orbitalfit}.",
        "7. Set up priors for the orbital fit: uniform priors on all orbital elements within physically reasonable ranges, and enforce a prior on the total system mass $(M_A + M_B + M_C)$ to be between 3.5 and 7.0 $M_\\odot$ as specified in \\ref{sec:orbitalfit}.",
        "8. Run the initial orbitize! MCMC fit using the C-AB barycenter astrometry. Allow the algorithm to sample the posterior distribution of orbital elements: semi-major axis $a$, eccentricity $e$, inclination $i$, longitude of ascending node $\\Omega$, argument of periastron $\\omega$, and epoch of periastron passage $T_0$.",
        "9. Apply the stability criterion from \\ref{sec:orbitalfit}: for each posterior sample, calculate the periastron distance $q = a(1-e)$ of C relative to the AB barycenter. Use the Eggleton (1995) stability criterion with $q_{in} = M_A/M_B = 1.24$, $a_{AB} = 15.3$ au, and $e_{AB} = 0.1$ to derive the minimum periastron distance of 68 au.",
        "10. Filter the posterior samples by rejecting all orbits where the periastron distance $q < 68$ au. This removes dynamically unstable configurations as described in \\ref{sec:orbitalfit}.",
        "11. From the filtered posterior distribution, extract the orbital inclination $i$ samples. The inclination should be measured in degrees from the reference plane (AB orbital plane).",
        "12. Calculate the median inclination value and the 16th and 84th percentiles to determine the $1\\sigma$ uncertainty bounds. Convert the uncertainty to a symmetric error estimate.",
        "13. Verify that the filtered posterior shows convergence by checking that the inclination distribution is well-constrained, similar to the results shown in \\ref{fig:v773caei} where $i = 97 \\pm 1$ degrees.",
        "14. Return the results as a list of two values: [median_inclination_degrees, uncertainty_degrees], where both values are rounded to one decimal place for consistency with the paper's reported precision."
