    "description": "Determine the projected chord width 'w' of the eclipsing disc from the light curve model.",
    "instructions": [
        "1. Load the combined photometric light curve data from `v773tau_complete_lightcurve.csv` covering the 2010 eclipse event.",
        "2. Extract the time and flux columns, filtering for data during the eclipse period around MJD 55450 as shown in \\ref{fig:lc}.",
        "3. Normalize the flux data using out-of-eclipse baseline measurements to create relative flux values.",
        "4. Import the orbital parameters for the AB system from \\ref{tab:orbs} 'this work' column: Period = 26.50 yr, $T_0$ = 2010.11 yr, $e$ = 0.104, $\\omega_A$ = 266.0 deg, $\\Omega$ = 290.54 deg, $i$ = 69.25 deg, $a$ = 117.7 mas.",
        "5. Convert the orbital elements to appropriate units for calculation (years to days, mas to AU using distance of 132.8 pc from \\ref{tab:physparams}).",
        "6. Calculate the positions of components Aa, Ab, and B as functions of time during the eclipse using Keplerian orbital mechanics.",
        "7. Implement the toy model described in \\ref{sec:model} representing the disc as a cylindrical slab with Gaussian absorption profile: $A(z) = A_0 \\exp(-(z/\\sigma_{disc})^2)$.",
        "8. Set up the model parameters including disc tilt angle $\\theta_{disc}$, maximum absorption $A_{max}$, scale height $\\sigma_{disc}$, and chord width $w$.",
        "9. Calculate the projected path of Aa and Ab behind the B component using the orbital solution, accounting for the disc inclination.",
        "10. Define the model flux function: $F(t) = f(F(Ab)/F(Aa), w, \\sigma_{disc}, A_{max}, \\theta_{disc})$ as specified in \\ref{sec:model}.",
        "11. Import the `emcee` MCMC package and set up 100 walkers with 300 burn-in steps as mentioned in the paper.",
        "12. Configure the MCMC to fit the free parameters with the flux ratio $F(Ab)/F(Aa)$ as a free parameter (corresponding to the 'All free' case in \\ref{tab:diskparams}).",
        "13. Set appropriate priors for each parameter based on physical constraints and expected ranges from the paper.",
        "14. Run the MCMC fitting procedure to minimize $\\chi^2$ between the model and observed light curve data.",
        "15. Extract the posterior distributions for all fitted parameters, particularly the chord width $w$.",
        "16. Calculate the best-fit value and uncertainty for the chord width using the 50th percentile and 16th-84th percentile range of the posterior distribution.",
        "17. Convert the chord width from angular units (mas) to physical units if necessary using the system distance of 132.8 pc.",
        "18. Return the chord width and its uncertainty in milliarcseconds as a list of two values: [best_fit_value, uncertainty]."
