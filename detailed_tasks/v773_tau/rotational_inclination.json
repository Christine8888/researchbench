    "description": "Calculate the rotational inclination of the Aa star.",
    "instructions": [
        "1. Extract the rotational period for the Aa star from the TESS light curve analysis results, specifically using the longer of the two primary periods identified in the Lomb-Scargle periodogram.",
        "2. Set the rotational period for Aa to 3.09 days as specified in the task instructions and consistent with the analysis in \\ref{sec:variability}.",
        "3. Use the published stellar radius for Aa of $2.22 R_\\odot$ as cited from Boden et al. (2007) and listed in \\ref{tab:physparams}.",
        "4. Set the rotationally broadened velocity $v \\sin i$ for Aa to 38 km/s as cited from Boden et al. (2007) and mentioned in \\ref{sec:variability}.",
        "5. Convert the stellar radius from solar radii to kilometers using the solar radius: $R_\\odot = 6.96 \\times 10^5$ km.",
        "6. Calculate the stellar radius in km: $R_{Aa} = 2.22 \\times 6.96 \\times 10^5$ km.",
        "7. Convert the rotational period from days to seconds: $P_{rot} = 3.09 \\times 24 \\times 3600$ seconds.",
        "8. Calculate the equatorial rotational velocity assuming solid body rotation: $v_{eq} = \\frac{2\\pi R_{Aa}}{P_{rot}}$.",
        "9. Use the relationship between observed projected velocity and equatorial velocity: $v \\sin i = v_{eq} \\sin i_{rot}$ where $i_{rot}$ is the inclination of the rotational axis to the line of sight.",
        "10. Solve for the rotational inclination: $\\sin i_{rot} = \\frac{v \\sin i}{v_{eq}}$.",
        "11. Calculate the inclination angle: $i_{rot} = \\arcsin\\left(\\frac{v \\sin i}{v_{eq}}\\right)$.",
        "12. Convert the inclination from radians to degrees: $i_{rot,deg} = i_{rot} \\times \\frac{180}{\\pi}$.",
        "13. Propagate uncertainties through the calculation using the given uncertainties in stellar radius (\u00b10.20 $R_\\odot$) and $v \\sin i$ (\u00b14 km/s) from Boden et al. (2007).",
        "14. Use error propagation formulas or Monte Carlo sampling to determine the uncertainty in the calculated inclination.",
        "15. Account for the uncertainty in the rotational period determination from the TESS analysis (estimate \u00b10.1 days based on typical periodogram precision).",
        "16. Calculate the final uncertainty in the inclination by combining all sources of error in quadrature.",
        "17. Verify that the calculated inclination is physically reasonable (between 0\u00b0 and 90\u00b0) and consistent with the orbital inclination constraints.",
        "18. Return the rotational inclination and its uncertainty in degrees as a list of two values: [inclination_degrees, uncertainty_degrees]."
