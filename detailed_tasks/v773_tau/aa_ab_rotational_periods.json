    "instructions": [
        "1. Load the TESS light curve data from the file `v773tau_eleanor.csv` using appropriate data reading functions.",
        "2. Extract the time column (in MJD format) and flux measurements from the dataset.",
        "3. Filter the data to include only observations within the time range MJD 58816 to 58842 as specified in \\ref{sec:variability}.",
        "4. Remove any data points with NaN values or unrealistic flux measurements using sigma clipping or similar outlier rejection methods.",
        "5. Normalize the flux data by dividing by the median flux value to create relative flux measurements.",
        "6. Import the Lomb-Scargle periodogram function from `scipy.signal` or `astropy.timeseries`.",
        "7. Calculate the Lomb-Scargle periodogram for the normalized flux data over a frequency range corresponding to periods between 1 and 5 days.",
        "8. Use the formula: frequency_range = 1.0 / np.linspace(5.0, 1.0, 10000) to create appropriate frequency sampling.",
        "9. Compute the periodogram power spectrum using the filtered time and flux arrays.",
        "10. Identify peaks in the power spectrum using peak detection algorithms with appropriate height and prominence thresholds.",
        "11. Extract the two highest power peaks from the periodogram that correspond to periods between 1 and 5 days.",
        "12. Convert the peak frequencies back to periods using the relationship: period = 1.0 / frequency.",
        "13. Verify that the identified periods match the expected rotational periods of approximately 2.62 and 3.09 days as mentioned in \\ref{sec:variability}.",
        "14. Sort the two identified periods in ascending order.",
        "15. Return the two periods as a Python list with two float elements representing the periods in days."
