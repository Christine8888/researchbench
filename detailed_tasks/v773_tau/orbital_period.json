    "description": "Determine the orbital period of the V773 Tau AB system.",
    "instructions": [
        "1. Compile the astrometric measurements for the AB system from the literature sources mentioned in the paper.",
        "2. Extract data from Duch\u00eane et al. (2003) as referenced in \\ref{sec:orbitalfit}, including position angles and separations with their uncertainties.",
        "3. Include measurements from Boden et al. (2012) as listed in \\ref{tab:orbs} and referenced in \\ref{sec:orbitalfit}.",
        "4. Add the new astrometric measurement from this paper obtained with SPHERE/IRDIS as reported in \\ref{tab:newastrom}.",
        "5. Organize the astrometric data into the format required by the `orbitize!` package: epochs, position angles, separations, and their respective uncertainties.",
        "6. Set the system distance to 132.8 pc as specified in \\ref{tab:physparams} and the total AB mass to 5.27 $M_\\odot$ from the same table.",
        "7. Import and initialize the `orbitize!` package for orbital fitting using the MCMC sampler.",
        "8. Configure the MCMC parameters exactly as specified in \\ref{sec:orbitalfit}: 1000 walkers, 20 temperatures for parallel tempering, burn-in of 2000 steps per walker.",
        "9. Set the total number of MCMC steps to 1,000,000 as mentioned in the paper.",
        "10. Define appropriate priors for the orbital elements based on the constraints from previous studies and physical considerations.",
        "11. Initialize the walkers with starting positions distributed around reasonable initial guesses for the orbital parameters.",
        "12. Run the parallel-tempered MCMC fitting procedure to sample the posterior distribution of orbital parameters.",
        "13. Monitor the convergence of the chains using standard diagnostics such as the Gelman-Rubin statistic or autocorrelation analysis.",
        "14. Extract the posterior samples after discarding the burn-in period and ensuring proper convergence.",
        "15. Calculate the orbital period distribution from the posterior samples by extracting the period parameter for each accepted sample.",
        "16. Determine the 50th percentile (median) value of the period distribution as the best-fit orbital period.",
        "17. Convert the period from the native units used in `orbitize!` to years if necessary.",
        "18. Return the orbital period in years as a single float value representing the 50th percentile of the posterior distribution."
