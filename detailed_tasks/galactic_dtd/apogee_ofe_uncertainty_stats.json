    "description": "Calculate the median and dispersion (95th - 5th percentile) of the [O/Fe] uncertainty for the selected APOGEE sample.",
    "instructions": [
        "1. Load the APOGEE data from `sample.csv` using appropriate data reading functions, ensuring access to all stellar parameters, chemical abundances, and uncertainties.",
        "2. Calculate galactocentric radius $R_{\\text{gal}}$ for each star using the Gaia EDR3 distance estimates: $R_{\\text{gal}} = \\sqrt{(R_{\\odot} - d \\cos(b) \\cos(l))^2 + (d \\cos(b) \\sin(l))^2}$ with $R_{\\odot} = 8.122$ kpc.",
        "3. Calculate height above the Galactic midplane: $z = d \\sin(b) + z_{\\odot}$ with $z_{\\odot} = 20.8$ pc, where $d$ is the distance, $l$ is Galactic longitude, and $b$ is Galactic latitude.",
        "4. Apply the surface gravity cut: $1.0 < \\log g < 3.8$ to select red giant branch and red clump stars.",
        "5. Apply the effective temperature cut: $3500 < T_{\\text{eff}} < 5500$ K for reliable abundance determination.",
        "6. Apply the signal-to-noise ratio cut: S/N $> 80$ to ensure high-quality spectra.",
        "7. Apply the ASPCAP quality flag filter: exclude stars with ASPCAPFLAG bit 23 set, indicating problematic parameter fits.",
        "8. Apply the target selection filter: exclude stars with EXTRATARG bits 0, 1, 2, 3, or 4 set to maintain sample purity.",
        "9. Apply the age uncertainty cut: retain only stars with L23 age uncertainty (`Age_sigma_L23`) $< 40\\\\%$.",
        "10. Apply the galactocentric radius cut: $3 < R_{\\text{gal}} < 15$ kpc to focus on the disk population.",
        "11. Apply the height cut: $|z| < 2$ kpc to exclude halo stars.",
        "12. Extract the [O/Fe] uncertainty values from the `O_FE_ERR` column for all stars passing the quality cuts.",
        "13. Calculate the median value of the `O_FE_ERR` distribution using appropriate statistical functions.",
        "14. Calculate the 5th percentile and 95th percentile of the `O_FE_ERR` distribution.",
        "15. Compute the uncertainty dispersion as the difference: dispersion $= P_{95} - P_5$, where $P_{95}$ and $P_5$ are the 95th and 5th percentiles respectively.",
        "16. Return the results as a list: `[median_uncertainty, uncertainty_dispersion]` where both values represent the [O/Fe] uncertainty characteristics in dex."
