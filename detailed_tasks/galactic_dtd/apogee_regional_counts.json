    "description": "Count the number of selected APOGEE stars within specified Galactocentric radius (Rgal) and midplane distance (|z|) bins.",
    "instructions": [
        "1. Load the APOGEE data from `sample.csv` using appropriate data reading functions, ensuring access to all stellar parameters, abundances, and Gaia EDR3 astrometric data.",
        "2. Calculate galactocentric radius $R_{\\text{gal}}$ for each star using the Gaia EDR3 distance estimates and the formula: $R_{\\text{gal}} = \\sqrt{(R_{\\odot} - d \\cos(b) \\cos(l))^2 + (d \\cos(b) \\sin(l))^2}$, where $R_{\\odot} = 8.122$ kpc.",
        "3. Calculate height above the Galactic midplane $z$ using: $z = d \\sin(b) + z_{\\odot}$, where $z_{\\odot} = 20.8$ pc and $d$ is the Bailer-Jones et al. (2021) distance estimate.",
        "4. Apply the stellar parameter quality cuts: $1.0 < \\log g < 3.8$ to select giant stars only.",
        "5. Apply the temperature cut: $3500 < T_{\\text{eff}} < 5500$ K to ensure reliable stellar parameter determination.",
        "6. Apply the signal-to-noise ratio cut: S/N $> 80$ for accurate abundance measurements.",
        "7. Apply the ASPCAP quality flag cut: exclude stars with ASPCAPFLAG bit 23 set, which indicates problematic stellar parameter determination.",
        "8. Apply the target selection cut: exclude stars with EXTRATARG bits 0, 1, 2, 3, or 4 set to maintain the main red star sample.",
        "9. Apply the age quality cut: retain only stars with L23 age uncertainty (`Age_sigma_L23`) $< 40\\\\%$ as specified in \\ref{sec:observational_sample}.",
        "10. Apply the spatial cuts: $3 < R_{\\text{gal}} < 15$ kpc to exclude bulge and extreme outer-disk stars.",
        "11. Apply the height cut: $|z| < 2$ kpc to exclude halo contamination.",
        "12. After applying all quality cuts, identify stars falling into the first spatial bin: $7 < R_{\\text{gal}} \\leq 9$ kpc and $0.5 < |z| \\leq 1.0$ kpc.",
        "13. Count the number of stars in this first bin and store as `count_bin1`.",
        "14. Identify stars falling into the second spatial bin: $9 < R_{\\text{gal}} \\leq 11$ kpc and $0.0 \\leq |z| \\leq 0.5$ kpc.",
        "15. Count the number of stars in this second bin and store as `count_bin2`.",
        "16. Return the two counts as a list: `[count_bin1, count_bin2]` representing the stellar populations in these specific Galactic regions."

The value listed for Rgal=(7, 9] kpc, |z|=(0.5, 1.0] kpc is 13811. The value listed for Rgal=(9, 11] kpc, |z|=(0.0, 0.5] kpc is 16276.
