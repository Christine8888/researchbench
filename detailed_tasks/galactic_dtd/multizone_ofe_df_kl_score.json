    "description": "Calculate the weighted average Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence score comparing the model [O/Fe] distribution to the APOGEE [O/Fe] distribution for the Inside-Out SFH combined with the Triple-system DTD.",
    "instructions": [
        "1. Extract and load the multi-zone simulation output from `multizone.tar.gz`, specifically identifying the model that combines the Inside-Out Star Formation History (SFH) with the Triple-system Delay-Time Distribution (DTD) as described in \\ref{sec:methods}.",
        "2. Load the APOGEE data from `sample.csv` and calculate galactocentric radius $R_{\\text{gal}}$ and height $z$ using the Gaia EDR3 data with solar parameters $R_{\\odot} = 8.122$ kpc and $z_{\\odot} = 20.8$ pc.",
        "3. Apply all quality cuts from \\ref{tab:quality_cuts}: $1.0 < \\log g < 3.8$, $3500 < T_{\\text{eff}} < 5500$ K, S/N $> 80$, ASPCAPFLAG bit 23 not set, EXTRATARG bits 0-4 not set, L23 age uncertainty $< 40\\\\%$, $3 < R_{\\text{gal}} < 15$ kpc, $|z| < 2$ kpc.",
        "4. For each model stellar population in the VICE simulation output, apply random Gaussian scatter to the [O/Fe] abundance values.",
        "5. Draw the standard deviation for the Gaussian scatter from the median observational uncertainty of $0.019$ dex reported in \\ref{tab:uncertainties}, or use this value directly for all stellar populations.",
        "6. Ensure that the scattered [O/Fe] values maintain physical bounds and realistic abundance ranges consistent with Galactic chemical evolution.",
        "7. Divide the model stellar populations into the 18 Galactic regions using the same $R_{\\text{gal}}$ bins (3-5, 5-7, 7-9, 9-11, 11-13, 13-15 kpc) and $|z|$ bins (0-0.5, 0.5-1.0, 1.0-2.0 kpc) as the APOGEE data.",
        "8. Apply mass weighting to the model stellar populations when creating distributions, using the stellar mass of each population as weights.",
        "9. For each of the 18 Galactic regions, estimate the probability density function (PDF) of [O/Fe] for the model stellar populations using histogram binning with bin width $\\Delta[\\text{O/Fe}] = 0.01$ dex or kernel density estimation.",
        "10. Similarly, estimate the PDF of [O/Fe] for the APOGEE stellar sample in each region using the same binning or estimation method.",
        "11. Calculate the Kullback-Leibler divergence $D_{\\text{KL}}(P||Q)$ for each region using \\ref{eq:kl_divergence}: $D_{\\text{KL}}(P||Q) = \\int p(x) \\log\\left(\\frac{p(x)}{q(x)}\\right) dx$, where $P$ is the APOGEE PDF, $Q$ is the model PDF, and $x = [\\text{O/Fe}]$.",
        "12. Implement numerical integration over the PDFs using an integration step size $d[\\text{O/Fe}] = 0.01$ dex, ensuring proper handling of zero-probability regions to avoid numerical instabilities.",
        "13. For each region, determine the number of APOGEE stars $N_{\\text{star}}(R_{\\text{gal}}, |z|)$ either by direct counting from the processed `sample.csv` data or by using the approximate values from \\ref{tab:stellar_counts}.",
        "14. Compute the final score $S$ as the weighted average of KL divergence values across all 18 regions using \\ref{eq:weighted_score}: $S = \\frac{\\sum_{\\text{regions}} D_{\\text{KL}} \\cdot N_{\\text{star}}}{\\sum_{\\text{regions}} N_{\\text{star}}}$.",
        "15. Return the final score $S$ as a single numerical value representing the overall agreement between the model and observed [O/Fe] distributions across the Galactic disk."
