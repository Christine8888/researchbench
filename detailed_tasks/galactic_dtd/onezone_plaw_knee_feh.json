    "instructions": [
        "1. Extract the multi-zone simulation output from the `multizone.tar.gz` archive using appropriate decompression tools.",
        "2. Navigate to the simulation directory and identify the model corresponding to the fiducial inside-out star formation history (SFH) combined with the power-law delay-time distribution (DTD) with slope $\\alpha = -1.1$.",
        "3. Load the simulation output files using the VICE package or appropriate data reading functions to access the interstellar medium (ISM) abundance history data.",
        "4. Locate the annulus corresponding to the solar neighborhood by identifying the zone with galactocentric radius $R_{\\text{gal}} = 8.0 - 8.1$ kpc in the simulation grid.",
        "5. Extract the time-dependent ISM abundance data for this specific annulus, focusing on the [Fe/H] and [O/Fe] abundance ratios as functions of time.",
        "6. Create arrays of [Fe/H] and [O/Fe] values from the ISM history, ensuring proper time ordering from early to late times in the simulation.",
        "7. Plot [O/Fe] versus [Fe/H] for the ISM abundance track to visualize the chemical evolution trajectory for this annulus.",
        "8. Identify the 'knee' feature in the [O/Fe] vs [Fe/H] track, which appears as the sharpest downturn in [O/Fe] values occurring shortly after the minimum SN Ia delay time $t_D = 40$ Myr.",
        "9. Locate this knee by finding the point where the slope $d[\\text{O/Fe}]/d[\\text{Fe/H}]$ becomes most negative, typically occurring at the transition from core-collapse supernova dominated to Type Ia supernova dominated enrichment.",
        "10. Extract the [Fe/H] value at the identified knee position, which represents the metallicity at which Type Ia supernovae begin to significantly impact the chemical evolution.",
        "11. Report the approximate [Fe/H] value corresponding to this knee as a single numerical value with appropriate precision (typically to 0.1 dex).",
        "12. Verify the result by checking that the knee occurs at the expected location based on the power-law DTD parameters and the inside-out SFH timescales described in \\ref{sec:methods}."
