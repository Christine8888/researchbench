    "description": "Calculate the weighted average RMS median age difference score comparing the model Age-[O/Fe] relation to the APOGEE/L23 data for the Two-infall SFH combined with the Triple-system DTD.",
    "instructions": [
        "1. Extract and load the multi-zone VICE simulation output from `multizone.tar.gz`, specifically locating the model that combines the Two-infall Star Formation History (SFH) with the Triple-system Delay-Time Distribution (DTD) as described in \\ref{sec:methods}.",
        "2. Load the APOGEE data from `sample.csv` using appropriate data reading functions, ensuring all columns including stellar parameters, abundances, and Gaia EDR3 astrometric data are accessible.",
        "3. Calculate galactocentric radius $R_{\\text{gal}}$ and height above the midplane $z$ for each APOGEE star using the Gaia EDR3 data with the specified solar parameters: $R_{\\odot} = 8.122$ kpc and $z_{\\odot} = 20.8$ pc.",
        "4. Apply the quality cuts specified in \\ref{tab:quality_cuts}: $1.0 < \\log g < 3.8$, $3500 < T_{\\text{eff}} < 5500$ K, S/N $> 80$, ASPCAPFLAG bit 23 not set, EXTRATARG bits 0, 1, 2, 3, or 4 not set.",
        "5. Merge the APOGEE data with the L23 age estimates, retaining only stars with L23 age uncertainty (`Age_sigma_L23`) $< 40\\\\%$ as recommended in \\ref{sec:observational_sample}.",
        "6. Apply additional spatial cuts: $3 < R_{\\text{gal}} < 15$ kpc and $|z| < 2$ kpc to focus on the Galactic disk population.",
        "7. For each model stellar population in the VICE simulation output, apply random Gaussian scatter to the [O/Fe] abundance using the median observational uncertainty of $0.019$ dex from \\ref{tab:uncertainties}.",
        "8. Apply random Gaussian scatter to the logarithmic age values $\\log(\\text{Age}/\\text{Gyr})$ for model stellar populations using the median uncertainty of $0.10$ dex from \\ref{tab:uncertainties}.",
        "9. Convert logarithmic ages to linear ages in Gyr for both model stellar populations and APOGEE/L23 data: $\\text{Age} = 10^{\\log(\\text{Age}/\\text{Gyr})}$.",
        "10. Divide both model and observational samples into the 18 Galactic regions defined by $R_{\\text{gal}}$ bins (3-5, 5-7, 7-9, 9-11, 11-13, 13-15 kpc) and $|z|$ bins (0-0.5, 0.5-1.0, 1.0-2.0 kpc).",
        "11. Within each of the 18 regions, create [O/Fe] bins with width $0.05$ dex covering the full range of observed [O/Fe] values.",
        "12. For each [O/Fe] bin $k$ that contains stars from both the model and APOGEE/L23 samples, calculate the mass-weighted median age of model stars: $\\text{med}(\\tau_{\\text{VICE}})$ and the median age of APOGEE/L23 stars: $\\text{med}(\\tau_{\\text{L23}})$.",
        "13. Compute the age difference for each bin: $\\Delta\\tau_k = \\text{med}(\\tau_{\\text{VICE}}) - \\text{med}(\\tau_{\\text{L23}})$.",
        "14. Calculate the RMS median age difference for each region using \\ref{eq:rms_age}: $\\Delta\\tau_{\\text{RMS}} = \\sqrt{\\sum_k \\frac{(\\Delta\\tau_k)^2 \\cdot n_{\\text{L23},k}}{n_{\\text{L23,tot}}}}$, where $n_{\\text{L23},k}$ is the number of APOGEE/L23 stars in bin $k$ and $n_{\\text{L23,tot}}$ is the total number in the region.",
        "15. Exclude [O/Fe] bins that contain no model stars or no observed stars from the RMS calculation to avoid undefined or biased results.",
        "16. Compute the final score $S$ as the weighted average of $\\Delta\\tau_{\\text{RMS}}$ values across all 18 regions: $S = \\sum_{\\text{regions}} \\Delta\\tau_{\\text{RMS}} \\cdot n_{\\text{L23,tot}} / \\sum_{\\text{regions}} n_{\\text{L23,tot}}$.",
        "17. Return the final score $S$ as a single numerical value representing the overall agreement between model and observed age-abundance relations."
