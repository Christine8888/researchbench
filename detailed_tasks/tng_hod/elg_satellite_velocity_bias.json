    "instructions": [
        "1. Load the selected DESI ELG mock galaxy sample (N=4998) following the same data loading procedure as in the previous tasks, including IllustrisTNG-300-1 subhalos, DMO halos, matching indices, and photometry data.",
        "2. Apply the DESI ELG selection criteria with $\\delta m = 0.6$ magnitude correction to identify the ELG sample as specified in \\ref{equ:elg_cuts}.",
        "3. For each ELG, identify its host DMO halo using the matching indices and determine if it is a satellite galaxy (not the most massive subhalo in its host halo).",
        "4. Extract satellite ELGs by filtering for galaxies that are not the most massive subhalo within their respective host DMO halos.",
        "5. For each satellite ELG, obtain its 3D velocity vector from the IllustrisTNG subhalo catalog: $\\vec{v}_{\\mathrm{gal}}$.",
        "6. For each satellite ELG's host halo, obtain the halo bulk velocity from the DMO halo catalog: $\\vec{v}_{\\mathrm{halo}}$.",
        "7. Calculate the peculiar velocity of each satellite ELG relative to its host halo: $\\vec{v}_{\\mathrm{pec}} = \\vec{v}_{\\mathrm{gal}} - \\vec{v}_{\\mathrm{halo}}$.",
        "8. Calculate the magnitude of the peculiar velocity: $v_{\\mathrm{pec}} = |\\vec{v}_{\\mathrm{pec}}|$.",
        "9. For each host halo, approximate the halo velocity dispersion using the velocity dispersion of its largest subhalo divided by 1.23 as described in \\ref{sec:results}: $\\sigma_{\\mathrm{halo}} = \\sigma_{\\mathrm{largest\\\\_subhalo}} / 1.23$.",
        "10. Calculate the standard deviation of satellite peculiar velocities: $\\sigma_{\\mathrm{pec,sat}} = \\mathrm{std}(v_{\\mathrm{pec}})$ for all satellite ELGs.",
        "11. Calculate the average halo velocity dispersion for hosts of satellite ELGs: $\\langle\\sigma_{\\mathrm{halo}}\\rangle$.",
        "12. Calculate the satellite velocity bias parameter: $\\alpha_s = \\sigma_{\\mathrm{pec,sat}} / \\langle\\sigma_{\\mathrm{halo}}\\rangle$.",
        "13. Output the satellite velocity bias parameter $\\alpha_s$ and compare with the expected result of approximately 1.01 as mentioned in \\ref{sec:results}."
