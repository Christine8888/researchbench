    "description": "Plot the north-south asymmetry in the vertical number counts of Gaia DR2 stars as a function of vertical height from the Galactic mid-plane.",
    "instructions": [
        "1. Load the Gaia DR2 data and apply the same quality cuts and sample selection as described in \\ref{sec:data}: parallax > 0, parallax_over_error > 5, $7 < G < 17$, projected heliocentric distance $\\leq 250$ pc.",
        "2. Use the precomputed color slice definitions with $G_{\\text{BP}} - G_{\\text{RP}}$ ranges (\\texttt{br_min}, \\texttt{br_max}) and corresponding main-sequence $M_G$ cuts (\\texttt{M_bright}, \\texttt{M_faint}) as defined in \\ref{sec:data}.",
        "3. For each star, calculate the corrected vertical height: $z_{\\text{corrected}} = z_{\\text{obs}} + z_\\odot$.",
        "4. Bin the corrected stellar heights using $\\Delta z = 25$ pc bins from $z = 0$ to $z = 1.5$ kpc, consistent with the binning procedure in \\ref{sec:VC}.",
        "5. For each color bin and each height bin $z_i$, calculate the number count asymmetry: $A(z_i) = \\frac{n(z_i) - n(-z_i)}{n(z_i) + n(-z_i)}$ using \\ref{eq:asym}.",
        "6. For each height bin, compute the median asymmetry across all color bins to obtain the overall asymmetry trend.",
        "7. Estimate uncertainties for individual color bin asymmetries using Poisson statistics: $\\sigma_A \\approx \\sqrt{\\frac{1}{n(z)} + \\frac{1}{n(-z)}}$.",
        "8. Calculate uncertainties for the median asymmetry using bootstrap resampling of the color bin values at each height.",
        "9. Create a color-coding scheme for the individual color bins, with bluer bins in blue colors and redder bins in yellow/red colors, matching the scheme used in \\ref{fig:ncount}.",
        "10. Generate a PNG figure plotting $A(z)$ vs $z$ from 0 to 1.5 kpc, with individual color bin results as small colored dots and overall median asymmetry as larger triangular markers.",
        "11. Include appropriate axis labels: '$A(z)$' for the y-axis and '$z$ (kpc)' for the x-axis.",
        "12. Add error bars to the median asymmetry points representing the bootstrap uncertainties.",
        "13. Save the figure as a PNG file with resolution suitable for publication (300 DPI minimum)."
