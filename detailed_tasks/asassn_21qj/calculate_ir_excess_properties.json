    "description": "Calculate the peak fractional luminosity and temperature of the infrared excess using NEOWISE data.",
    "instructions": [
        "1. Load the NEOWISE photometry data from the files 'ASASSN-21qj_2013-2022.tbl' and 'neowise_rvc.csv' using appropriate astronomical data reading libraries (e.g., astropy.table or pandas).",
        "2. Filter the data to identify pre-brightening observations by selecting all measurements with Modified Julian Date (MJD) < 58700, as specified in \\ref{sec:methods}.",
        "3. Calculate the median pre-brightening flux values for both $W1$ (3.4 $\\mu$m) and $W2$ (4.6 $\\mu$m) bands from the filtered pre-brightening data.",
        "4. Identify post-brightening observations by selecting all measurements with MJD $\\geq$ 58700 and determine the epoch corresponding to the peak infrared excess by finding the maximum flux values in both bands after brightening.",
        "5. Calculate the excess flux at the peak epoch by subtracting the median pre-brightening fluxes from the peak post-brightening fluxes for both $W1$ and $W2$ bands: $F_{excess,W1} = F_{peak,W1} - F_{median,pre,W1}$ and $F_{excess,W2} = F_{peak,W2} - F_{median,pre,W2}$.",
        "6. Apply contamination correction for the nearby star (Gaia DR3 5539970597334497024) as described in \\ref{sec:methods} by using Gaia photometry for the contaminating source and the post/pre-brightening flux difference method.",
        "7. Convert the corrected excess fluxes from magnitudes to physical flux units (Jy) using the WISE zero-point calibrations: $F_{\\nu} = F_0 \\times 10^{-0.4 \\times m}$ where $F_0$ is the zero-point flux.",
        "8. Fit a blackbody model to the excess $W1$ and $W2$ fluxes using the Planck function: $B_{\\nu}(T) = \\frac{2h\\nu^3}{c^2} \\frac{1}{e^{h\\nu/kT} - 1}$ where $\\nu$ corresponds to the effective frequencies of the $W1$ and $W2$ bands.",
        "9. Perform a least-squares optimization to determine the best-fit blackbody temperature $T$ (in Kelvin) by minimizing the chi-squared statistic between the observed excess fluxes and the blackbody model.",
        "10. Calculate the fractional luminosity $L_{dust}/L_{star}$ using the fitted blackbody parameters and the stellar luminosity from \\ref{tab:Stellarprop}, following the method described in \\ref{sec:methods}.",
        "11. Estimate uncertainties on both temperature and fractional luminosity using bootstrap resampling or error propagation from the flux uncertainties.",
        "12. Return the results as a tuple in the format (temperature, fractional_luminosity) where temperature is in Kelvin and fractional_luminosity is dimensionless."
