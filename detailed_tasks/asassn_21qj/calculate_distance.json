    "instructions": [
        "1. Access the Gaia DR3 catalog data for ASASSN-21qj using the source identifier Gaia DR3 5539970601632026752.",
        "2. Extract the parallax measurement ($\\varpi$) and its associated uncertainty ($\\sigma_{\\varpi}$) from the Gaia DR3 data, as listed in \\ref{tab:Stellarprop}.",
        "3. Verify that the parallax value matches the expected value of $1.763 \\pm 0.011$ mas from \\ref{tab:Stellarprop}.",
        "4. Implement the Bailer-Jones et al. (2021, AJ, 161, 147) geometric distance estimation method, which uses a Galaxy model prior to convert parallax measurements to distance estimates.",
        "5. Apply the exponentially decreasing space density prior with scale length $L = 1.35$ kpc as described in the Bailer-Jones et al. method.",
        "6. Calculate the posterior probability distribution for distance using the likelihood function: $p(d|\\varpi, \\sigma_{\\varpi}) \\propto p(\\varpi|d) \\times p(d)$ where $p(\\varpi|d) = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2\\pi}\\sigma_{\\varpi}} \\exp\\left(-\\frac{(\\varpi - 1/d)^2}{2\\sigma_{\\varpi}^2}\\right)$.",
        "7. Determine the mode of the posterior distribution by finding the distance value that maximizes the posterior probability.",
        "8. Verify that the calculated distance is consistent with the expected value of $567.2^{+6.7}_{-5.9}$ pc from \\ref{tab:Stellarprop}.",
        "9. Handle potential negative parallax cases by ensuring the distance calculation remains physically meaningful.",
        "10. Return the distance estimate corresponding to the mode of the posterior distribution in units of parsecs."
