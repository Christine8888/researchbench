    "instructions": [
        "1. Load the ASAS-SN $g'$ band photometry data from the files 'light_curve_410e0d3c-687e-40a3-b7cb-af0057695e0b.csv' and 'asassn_rvc.csv'.",
        "2. Convert magnitudes to normalized flux using $f(t) = 10^{(M(t) - M_0)/(-2.5)}$ where $M_0$ is the mean magnitude before MJD 58700 (out-of-eclipse baseline).",
        "3. Calculate the baseline flux by computing the mean flux for all observations with MJD < 58700.",
        "4. Normalize all flux measurements by dividing by the baseline flux value.",
        "5. Identify the eclipse period by selecting data points with MJD between approximately 59350 and 59850, as specified in \\ref{sec:methods}.",
        "6. Visually inspect the eclipse light curve and identify segments showing approximately linear flux changes by detecting turning points in the photometric variations.",
        "7. For each identified linear segment, fit a straight line using least-squares regression to determine the flux gradient $df/dt$ in units of day$^{-1}$.",
        "8. Apply the Kennedy et al. (2017) method from equations 4.2 and 4.3 to convert flux gradients to transverse velocity lower limits using: $v_{trans} \\geq \\frac{2R_{star}}{|df/dt|} \\times \\frac{1}{f_{depth}}$ where $R_{star} = 1.04 R_{\\odot}$ from \\ref{tab:Stellarprop}.",
        "9. Calculate the transverse velocity for each linear segment, ensuring to use the steepest (most negative) gradients as these provide the most stringent lower limits.",
        "10. Identify the overall minimum robust transverse velocity from all calculated values, representing the most conservative constraint.",
        "11. Assume this minimum transverse velocity corresponds to the Keplerian orbital velocity: $v_k = \\sqrt{\\frac{GM_{star}}{a_{max}}}$ where $M_{star} = 1.0 M_{\\odot}$.",
        "12. Solve for the maximum orbital separation using $a_{max} = \\frac{GM_{star}}{v_k^2}$ where $G = 6.674 \\times 10^{-11}$ m$^3$ kg$^{-1}$ s$^{-2}$.",
        "13. Convert the result from meters to astronomical units using the conversion factor 1 AU = $1.496 \\times 10^{11}$ m.",
        "14. Verify that the calculated $a_{max}$ is consistent with the expected constraint of approximately 16 au mentioned in \\ref{sec:methods}.",
        "15. Return the maximum orbital separation $a_{max}$ in astronomical units."

If the dust is on a circular orbit, it therefore has to be within 16 au'. The calculation v_min = 7.5 km/s -> a_max = GM*/v_min^2 yields approx 15.7 au, consistent with the paper's stated value of 16 au.",
