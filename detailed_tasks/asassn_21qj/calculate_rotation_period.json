    "instructions": [
        "1. Access the TESS Quick-Look Pipeline (QLP) light curve data for ASASSN-21qj from Sector 8 using the file 'hlsp_qlp_tess_ffi_s0008-0000000182582608_tess_v01_llc.fits'.",
        "2. Load the FITS file using astropy.io.fits and extract the light curve data including time (BJD), flux, and flux error columns.",
        "3. Convert the time stamps from Barycentric Julian Date (BJD) to a more convenient time format if necessary, ensuring proper time baseline for period analysis.",
        "4. Remove any obvious outliers or bad data points by applying quality flags and sigma-clipping to eliminate measurements with unusually large flux errors or non-physical values.",
        "5. Normalize the flux data by dividing by the median flux value to center the light curve around unity.",
        "6. Implement the Lomb-Scargle periodogram algorithm using scipy.signal.lombscargle or astropy.timeseries.LombScargle for unevenly sampled time series analysis.",
        "7. Define an appropriate frequency grid for the periodogram analysis, covering periods from approximately 0.1 days to 20 days to capture stellar rotation signals.",
        "8. Calculate the Lomb-Scargle power spectrum and identify peaks in the periodogram that exceed the noise threshold.",
        "9. Apply false alarm probability analysis to determine the statistical significance of detected peaks, typically requiring FAP < 0.01 for reliable detection.",
        "10. Exclude trivial aliases such as the 1-day period (related to Earth's rotation and observational cadence) and its harmonics from consideration.",
        "11. Identify the period corresponding to the most significant peak in the periodogram, which should represent the stellar rotation period.",
        "12. Verify that the detected period is consistent with the expected value of approximately 4.43 days mentioned in \\ref{sec:methods}.",
        "13. Calculate the uncertainty in the period determination using bootstrap resampling or analytical error estimation methods.",
        "14. Cross-validate the result by checking for consistency with any periodic signals in other TESS sectors if available.",
        "15. Return the stellar rotation period in units of days."
