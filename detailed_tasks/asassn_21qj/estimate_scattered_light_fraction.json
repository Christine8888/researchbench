    "description": "Estimate the fraction of scattered light contributing during the optical dimming using AAVSO BVI photometry.",
    "instructions": [
        "1. Load the AAVSO photometry data from the files 'aavsodata_63e2220f49f39.txt' and 'aavso_rvc.txt' containing $B$, $V$, and $I$ band measurements.",
        "2. Filter the data to remove measurements with large error bars (typically $> 0.1$ mag) and ensure data quality for color analysis.",
        "3. Calculate the $B-V$ and $V-I$ color indices for each observation epoch using standard photometric color definitions.",
        "4. Identify the dimming event period by selecting observations with MJD between approximately 59350 and 59850, corresponding to the deep eclipse phase.",
        "5. Create a color-magnitude diagram by plotting $V$ magnitude versus $B-V$ color for the dimming event data.",
        "6. Implement the Cardelli et al. (1989) interstellar extinction law with $R_V = 3.1$ to model the reddening relationship: $A_{\\lambda}/A_V = a(\\lambda) + b(\\lambda)/R_V$.",
        "7. Define the extinction + scattering model as: $F_{obs} = F_{star} \\times 10^{-0.4 A_{\\lambda}} + s \\times F_{star}$ where $s$ is the scattered light fraction and $F_{star}$ is the intrinsic stellar flux.",
        "8. Apply the model to both $B$ and $V$ bands, ensuring the scattered light component maintains the same intrinsic stellar color.",
        "9. Perform a least-squares fit to the $V$ vs $(B-V)$ data during the deep dimming phase where the 'blueing' effect is most apparent (typically when $V > 14.5$ mag).",
        "10. Optimize the model parameters, particularly the scattered light fraction $s$, to best match the observed color-magnitude relationship.",
        "11. Validate the fit by checking that the model reproduces the initial reddening followed by the return toward stellar colors at deeper eclipse depths.",
        "12. Extract the best-fit scattered light fraction from the optimization results.",
        "13. Convert the fractional scattered light component to a percentage by multiplying by 100.",
        "14. Verify that the result is consistent with the expected value of approximately 7.5% mentioned in \\ref{sec:methods}.",
        "15. Return the scattered light fraction as a percentage of the total unextincted stellar flux."
