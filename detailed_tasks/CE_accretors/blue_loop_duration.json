    "description": "Calculate the duration of the blue loops for the accretor models.",
    "instructions": [
        "1. Set up MESA (version 15140) with the following parameters: metallicity $Z = 0.0019$, initial orbital period $P = 100$ days, and initial binary masses $(M_1, M_2) = (18, 15)$, $(20, 17)$, and $(38, 30)$ $M_\\odot$.",
        "2. Configure MESA to simulate case B Roche lobe overflow (RLOF) evolution as described in \\ref{sec:methods}, including tidal interactions and rotationally-enhanced wind mass loss during accretion.",
        "3. Evolve each binary system through the complete RLOF phase until the donor detaches from its Roche lobe, allowing the accretor stars to grow to final masses of approximately $18$, $20$, and $36$ $M_\\odot$ respectively.",
        "4. After RLOF detachment, artificially separate the binary components and continue evolving only the accretor stars as single stars until they reach carbon depletion (central carbon mass fraction $X_\\mathrm{c}(^{12}\\mathrm{C}) < 2 \\times 10^{-4}$).",
        "5. During the post-RLOF evolution, monitor the effective temperature $T_\\mathrm{eff}$ and luminosity $L$ to identify blue loop phases as described in \\ref{sec:bin_models}.",
        "6. Define the blue loop as the excursion to hotter temperatures (increasing $\\log_{10}(T_\\mathrm{eff}/[\\mathrm{K}])$) after the star begins ascending the Hayashi track during helium core burning.",
        "7. For the two lowest mass accretors ($15 \\rightarrow 18$ $M_\\odot$ and $17 \\rightarrow 20$ $M_\\odot$), calculate the duration of their blue loop phases by measuring the time interval during which $\\log_{10}(T_\\mathrm{eff}/[\\mathrm{K}]) \\gtrsim 4.2$.",
        "8. Extract the stellar age at the beginning and end of each blue loop phase from the MESA history files.",
        "9. Calculate the blue loop duration in years for each of the two lowest mass accretors by taking the difference between the end and start times.",
        "10. Return the blue loop durations in years as a two-element array: [duration_18Msun, duration_20Msun]."
