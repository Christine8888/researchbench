    "description": "Calculate the minimum ratio of binding energy between accretor models and single stars of the same total post-RLOF mass.",
    "instructions": [
        "1. Set up MESA (version 15140) with the following parameters: metallicity $Z = 0.0019$, initial orbital period $P = 100$ days, and initial binary masses $(M_1, M_2) = (18, 15)$, $(20, 17)$, and $(38, 30)$ $M_\\odot$.",
        "2. Evolve the binary systems through RLOF as described in \\ref{sec:methods} until detachment, producing accretor models with post-RLOF masses of approximately $18$, $20$, and $36$ $M_\\odot$.",
        "3. For comparison, compute single star models with the same metallicity $Z = 0.0019$ and initial masses equal to the post-RLOF masses of the accretors ($18$, $20$, and $36$ $M_\\odot$).",
        "4. Continue evolving both the accretor models and single star comparison models until they reach a photospheric radius of $R = 500$ $R_\\odot$.",
        "5. At $R = 500$ $R_\\odot$, extract the stellar structure profiles including mass coordinate $m$, radius $r(m)$, and internal energy $u(m)$ from the MESA output files.",
        "6. Calculate the cumulative binding energy profiles using \\ref{eq:BE}: $BE(m, \\alpha_\\mathrm{th}) = -\\int_{m}^M dm' \\left(-\\frac{Gm'}{r(m')} + \\alpha_\\mathrm{th} u(m')\\right)$ with $\\alpha_\\mathrm{th} = 1$.",
        "7. For each mass configuration, compute the binding energy profiles for both the accretor model and the corresponding single star model of equivalent post-RLOF mass.",
        "8. Calculate the ratio of binding energies as a function of radius: $\\mathrm{ratio}(r) = BE_\\mathrm{accretor}(r) / BE_\\mathrm{single}(r)$.",
        "9. Identify the minimum value of this ratio for each of the three mass configurations by finding $\\min(\\mathrm{ratio}(r))$ across all radial coordinates.",
        "10. Return the three minimum ratio values as an array: [min_ratio_18Msun, min_ratio_20Msun, min_ratio_36Msun]."
