        "1. Set up MESA (version 15140) with metallicity $Z = 0.0019$ to compute a single star model with initial mass $M = 30$ $M_\\odot$.",
        "2. Configure MESA with the same physics setup described in \\ref{sec:methods}, including the small amount of mixing with diffusivity $\\texttt{min_D_mix} = 0.01$ cm$^2$ s$^{-1}$.",
        "3. Evolve the single star from zero age main sequence (ZAMS) until terminal age main sequence (TAMS), defined as when the central hydrogen mass fraction reaches $X_\\mathrm{c}(^1\\mathrm{H}) < 10^{-4}$.",
        "4. At TAMS, extract the stellar structure profile including mass coordinate $m$, hydrogen mass fraction $X(^1\\mathrm{H})$ as a function of mass coordinate.",
        "5. Determine the central hydrogen mass fraction $X_\\mathrm{c}(^1\\mathrm{H})$ and surface hydrogen mass fraction $X_\\mathrm{surf}(^1\\mathrm{H})$ from the MESA profile data.",
        "6. Define the core-envelope boundary (CEB) region as described in \\ref{sec:toy_models}: the mass range where $X_\\mathrm{c}(^1\\mathrm{H}) + 0.01 < X(^1\\mathrm{H}) < X_\\mathrm{surf}(^1\\mathrm{H}) - 0.01$.",
        "7. Identify the inner and outer mass coordinates of the CEB region by finding where the hydrogen mass fraction satisfies the boundary conditions.",
        "8. Calculate the mass thickness of the CEB region by taking the difference between the outer and inner mass coordinates: $\\Delta M_\\mathrm{CEB} = m_\\mathrm{outer} - m_\\mathrm{inner}$.",
        "9. Convert the mass thickness to solar masses if necessary and verify it is consistent with the expected value of approximately $5.81$ $M_\\odot$ mentioned in \\ref{fig:engineered_TAMS}.",
        "10. Return the mass thickness of the CEB region in solar masses as a single numerical value."
