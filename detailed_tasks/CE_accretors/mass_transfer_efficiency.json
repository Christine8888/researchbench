    "description": "Calculate the mass transfer efficiency during RLOF for the three binary systems.",
    "instructions": [
        "1. Load the MESA simulation outputs for the three binary systems with metallicity $Z = 0.0019$, initial orbital period $P = 100$ days, and initial masses $(M_1, M_2) = (18, 15)$, $(20, 17)$, and $(38, 30)$ $M_\\odot$ as described in \\ref{sec:methods}.",
        "2. For each binary system, identify the RLOF phase in the evolution data by locating the time period when mass transfer occurs between the donor and accretor stars, typically marked by changes in stellar masses and the yellow outline regions shown in the HR diagram analysis.",
        "3. Extract the initial mass of the donor star ($M_{\\text{donor,initial}}$) at the beginning of the RLOF phase for each system: $M_{\\text{donor,initial}} = 18$, $20$, and $38$ $M_\\odot$ respectively.",
        "4. Extract the final mass of the donor star ($M_{\\text{donor,final}}$) at the end of the RLOF phase when the donor detaches from its Roche lobe for each system.",
        "5. Calculate the total mass lost by the donor during RLOF: $\\Delta M_{\\text{donor}} = M_{\\text{donor,initial}} - M_{\\text{donor,final}}$ for each of the three systems.",
        "6. Extract the initial mass of the accretor star ($M_{\\text{accretor,initial}}$) at the beginning of the RLOF phase for each system: $M_{\\text{accretor,initial}} = 15$, $17$, and $30$ $M_\\odot$ respectively.",
        "7. Extract the final mass of the accretor star ($M_{\\text{accretor,final}}$) at the end of the RLOF phase for each system, which should be approximately $18$, $20$, and $36$ $M_\\odot$ respectively as mentioned in \\ref{sec:bin_models}.",
        "8. Calculate the total mass gained by the accretor during RLOF: $\\Delta M_{\\text{accretor}} = M_{\\text{accretor,final}} - M_{\\text{accretor,initial}}$ for each of the three systems.",
        "9. Compute the mass transfer efficiency for each binary system using the formula: $\\beta_{\\text{RLOF}} = |\\Delta M_{\\text{accretor}}/\\Delta M_{\\text{donor}}|$.",
        "10. Verify that the calculated efficiencies are consistent with the expected values mentioned in \\ref{sec:bin_models}: approximately $0.29$, $0.30$, and $0.43$ for the $(18,15)$, $(20,17)$, and $(38,30)$ $M_\\odot$ systems respectively.",
        "11. Handle any numerical precision issues by rounding the efficiency values to 3 decimal places to match the precision reported in the paper.",
        "12. Return the three mass transfer efficiency values as a list in the order: [$\\beta_{\\text{RLOF}}$(18,15), $\\beta_{\\text{RLOF}}$(20,17), $\\beta_{\\text{RLOF}}$(38,30)], ensuring each value represents $|\\Delta M_{\\text{accretor}}/\\Delta M_{\\text{donor}}|$ for the corresponding binary system."
