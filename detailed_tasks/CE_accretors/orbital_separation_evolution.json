    "description": "Calculate the orbital separation evolution during RLOF.",
    "instructions": [
        "1. Set up MESA (version 15140) with the following parameters: metallicity $Z = 0.0019$, initial orbital period $P = 100$ days, and initial binary masses $(M_1, M_2) = (18, 15)$, $(20, 17)$, and $(38, 30)$ $M_\\odot$.",
        "2. Calculate the initial orbital separation using Kepler's third law: $a_\\mathrm{initial} = \\left(\\frac{G(M_1 + M_2)P^2}{4\\pi^2}\\right)^{1/3}$ where $P = 100$ days and convert the result to solar radii.",
        "3. Evolve the binary systems through the complete RLOF phase as described in \\ref{sec:methods}, monitoring the orbital separation throughout the mass transfer process.",
        "4. Identify the moment of RLOF detachment when the donor star's radius becomes smaller than its Roche lobe radius, marking the end of the mass transfer phase.",
        "5. Extract the orbital separation at the moment of RLOF detachment from the MESA binary history files.",
        "6. Convert the detachment separation from the MESA output units to solar radii for consistency.",
        "7. As described in \\ref{sec:bin_models}, the binaries are expected to start with an initial separation of approximately $300$ $R_\\odot$ and widen to approximately $380$ $R_\\odot$ by RLOF detachment.",
        "8. Verify that the calculated values are consistent with the expected range mentioned in the paper.",
        "9. Return the two orbital separation values in solar radii as a two-element array: [initial_separation_Rsun, detachment_separation_Rsun]."
