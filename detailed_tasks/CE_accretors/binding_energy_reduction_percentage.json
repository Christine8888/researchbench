    "instructions": [
        "1. Set up MESA (version 15140) with the following parameters: metallicity $Z = 0.0019$, initial orbital period $P = 100$ days, and initial binary masses $(M_1, M_2) = (18, 15)$, $(20, 17)$, and $(38, 30)$ $M_\\odot$.",
        "2. Evolve the binary systems through RLOF until detachment, producing accretor models with post-RLOF masses of approximately $18$, $20$, and $36$ $M_\\odot$.",
        "3. For comparison, compute single star models with the same metallicity and initial masses equal to the post-RLOF masses of the accretors.",
        "4. Continue evolving both sets of models until they reach a photospheric radius of $R = 500$ $R_\\odot$.",
        "5. For each model at $R = 500$ $R_\\odot$, identify the helium core boundary as the outermost location where the hydrogen mass fraction $X < 0.01$ and helium mass fraction $Y > 0.1$, determining the helium core mass $M_\\mathrm{He}$.",
        "6. Calculate the envelope binding energy using \\ref{eq:BE_env}: $BE_\\mathrm{env} = BE(m = M_\\mathrm{He}, \\alpha_\\mathrm{th} = 1)$ where the integral in \\ref{eq:BE} runs from the helium core boundary to the stellar surface.",
        "7. For each of the three mass configurations, compute $BE_\\mathrm{env}$ for both the accretor model and the corresponding single star model.",
        "8. Calculate the percentage reduction in binding energy for each mass configuration: $\\mathrm{reduction}(\\\\%) = 100 \\times \\left(1 - \\frac{BE_\\mathrm{env,accretor}}{BE_\\mathrm{env,single}}\\right)$.",
        "9. Identify the minimum and maximum percentage reduction values across all three mass configurations.",
        "10. Verify that the results fall within the expected range of $42-96\\\\%$ reduction mentioned in the abstract.",
        "11. Return the minimum and maximum percentage reduction values as a two-element array: [min_reduction_percent, max_reduction_percent]."
